That means virtually every guy they send in there becomes a casualty. Russia sent a whole army from Kupiansk to Tokmak so the manpower advantage there that Ukraine had two weeks ago is gone; they now are outnumbered and they are on the attack----a recipe for disaster. This same \"they could crumble\" garbage from the Americans is what helped start the war; the believe \"oh they're all drunks\", \"they are running out of missiles\" , \"they have only shovels\" , \"they will run away at sight of a Leopard 2\".

Zaluzhny confirmed such a goal is not achievable and would require massively more money and even  then there is no guarantee. Russia has no interest in occupying the rest of Ukraine; the areas they annexed hold the Russia populations they were concerned with; at this point Russia is simply in a \"protect what we already have\" mode.

A significant amount of what\u2019s being cut off from Europe is natural gas, which can\u2019t easily be sourced elsewhere (as pipelines are static, and LNG can only substitute for some of the cut off). That means that the remaining shortfall will be petroleum, which is fungible. The oil market is a global commodities market - Europeans can buy what China is no longer purchasing from the Middle East.  Bottom line, global demand is only growing slowly, while supplies remain constant, and could increase suddenly if a new nuclear deal with Iran opens global markets to Iranian oil.

That's exactly what America is doing with Russia, Europe, China, and virtually every small country they deal with. If America can't compete, it destroys.  Everybody knows it and they silently support it. Remember when Pompeo bragged at a Texas A&M university that the CIA \"we lie, we steal, we cheat,' ? Well that's not really news but what I found scary was how the entire audience laughed and applauded.   Americans seem to support cheating and lying and destroying anyone who might succeed.

    "As much as we side with Ukraine, what filters through is that misery is greater and greater, the economy is grinding to a halt, and the Russians continue to drive wedges into locations. As much as the Ukrainians want and use the weaponry provided by the West, it produces a Frankenstein logistical situation with need for training, support, repair, and supply of a multitude of specialized munitions, parts & etc.   I just don\u2019t see how Ukraine alone can achieve more than a stalemate. And no NATO nation is going to put combat troops on the ground. For the US, it\u2019s an opportunity for us to grind down an enemy in a proxy war by providing military supplies to Ukraine, but we must be careful nonetheless- China is watching ITS potential opponents in a war over Taiwan deplete their equipment and supplies in what is effectively a proxy war for them, in which China expends absolutely nothing.\r",

This report may be completely wrong but there is a certain reasonable logic to it. If the US spent 100 billion dollars looking after the welfare of its own people and not interfering in the domestic affairs of other countries by way of coups and proxy and not so proxy wars, US population would be 100 billion dollars better of with free schools, hospitals, affordable housing for the working American poor, US infrastructure like rapid rail and functional public transport systems and the rest of the world wouldn't be guessing who is the next country on the US list to destroy.

    "There was nothing illegal about the invasion.  Indeed, Russia did everything entirely in accordance with International Law.  They attempted to get the French and Germans to fulfill their duty to bring Ukraine back into adherence with the Minsk Accords.  Those two WESTERN nations violated International Law in refusing to do so, aiding and abetting Ukraine's attacks on people they claimed as their own citizens.  Russia then gave the DPR and LPR diplomatic recognition, which is all that is required under International Law to legally say that they are sovereign states.  Next, Russia signed a Mutual Defense treaty with those two states which is very much like the treaty that created NATO.  The DPR and LPR invoked that treaty, which provided all the legal basis it needed to invade Ukraine, in order to stop Ukraine's campaign of military attacks on civilian population centers that over the previous 7 years killed more than 14,000 people, mainly civilians.  *STOP LYING ABOUT THE RUSSIAN INVASION BEING ILLEGAL OR UNPROVOKED.*  Whether or not the West approves of it, it is neither illegal nor unprovoked.\r",

These have in the past been used to buy expensive properties in London.

USA, and therefore unfortunately us vasallstates here in Europe provoked through this proxywar, and after being pushed to far Russia did as they had warned us that they would do if we didn't stop.

    "30:28 \"Putin started this war to prevent NATO expansion\". No Hamish, it was the prospect of Ukraine joining that Russia could not tolerate (as well as the thousands of ethnic Russians being killed in the Donbass). Obviously Russia won't be happy about Finland/Sweden joining but provided they don't build up troops and equipment from other NATO members at its border then Russia won't feel the need to reciprocate.   All this talk of negotiating terms over Crimea is ludicrous. It has been home to what is arguably Russias single most important military asset since the 18th century. Nothing - including the threat of a third world war - will persuade them to give it up. Then there's the not insignificant fact that the very pro-Russian population exercised their right to self-determination and voted with an overwhelming majority to be a part of the Russian Federation. Ukraine will just have to cope.\r",

Ludicrous that people ignored the coup, ignored shelling of Donblass, the politics of Azov, Right Sektor and the idiocy of wanting to push NATO up to Russian border and put missiles within 5mins of Moscow. US foreign policy is a disaster and this proxy war that's cost 200billion, the EU and UK affordable energy, causing huge rises in food prices when we're already struggling with inflation and for what? Did anyone want Ukraine in NATO or EU,? Why did we find the Minsk agreements so unacceptable? Why are we accepting an actor who seems allergic to a suit, going round in his green tee shirt begging more money and the weaponry to start WW3...he couldn't stop Azov or make them withdraw in 2015 but we're not bothered about there characters getting stronger politically?  The history of Ukraine didn't start in 2022, we've all heard the US State Dept calls discussing which person they want after getting the democratically elected ousted. It's f**kin ridiculous.\r",

    "The major mistake Russia made was trusting Western governments. After the collapse of the USSR, Russia was led to believe that its destiny was to be among the \"Golden Billion.\" Instead of acting in good faith, the West has done nothing but behave treacherously towards Russia, grossly violating all norms of international law.  The consequence is that any trust once given is now completely gone. In its place a great schism has formed between Russia and the West, and this schism is leading to many former Western colonial subjects allying with Russia. Economically and politically, they strive to rid themselves of unwanted Western control, for the benefit of their own sovereign integrity.  Due to this schism, Russia now sees its future as a leader of a \"Golden Majority\" anti-hegemony pact. All systems under Western control, including the financial system, will be replaced with systems outside of its influence. Western military control will be driven out at every opportunity, as has happened recently in a number of African states.  In the long term, such a schism will be good for all parties, including the West. Instead of focusing on the lost cause of global domination and furthering the power of the ruling elite, the West will be forced to examine its role in the world and restore focus to the interests of its own people.  tass.com/politics/17650\u2026  Yahoo Mail: Search, organise, conquer\r",
