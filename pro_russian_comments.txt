Small MSM payed by the Rand corp in billions are scared of the Russian 'propaganda' (aka the thruth). Oh noes.
The Ukranian people are no more, thanks to your 'help'.
Ukraine will never declare war against Russia because if it does, the West will be officially at war with Russia as an adversary. They know they're screwed regardless.
Ukraine is a battle US slave, not an ally.
And the money will go to the US military industrial complex, as pee usual. Aka money laundering.
Ukranian nationalists deyibetely will pay for everything, especially for the 400 billion loans US actually spent on itself. Congrats!
'Suddenly' advancing, of course. Suddenly and cowardly advancing, and Ukraine is braverly retreating.
​@@jhngfdsdfgkjnbvNah, those hypersonics will fly directly to Poland and Romania.
Absolutely. Ukranians bravely retreating and surrendering and Russia is cowardly advancing. Goebbels would be proud of the Telegraph.
Naturally. But they don't care about being tools for warmongers. They enjoy russophobia more than anything.
The left-wing EU/US NATO expansion isn't going well.
People are saying that NATO expansion isn't going well?
Europe needs to give more of their money to the globalist nato cause.
14:12. Israel has a huge influential lobbying group 💰💰. Many people don't like seeing Congress purchased by outside forces.
The woke western left-wing globalist expansion isn't going well.
Videos are showing alot of Ukrainian soldiers surrendering. The globalist are not doing well.
The globalist expansion of Nato doesn't seem to be going well?
Why is the birthrate so low with Europeans? People say it's feminism?
I always like to come here to get a fair and balanced show🤣🤣
The wealthy oligarch globalists in the EU are already talking about bringing in 5 million replacements from Africa and Asia into Ukraine after the war.
I heard tens of thousands of Ukrainians are fighting against Zelensky and fight alongside the Russians.
Free Gonzalo Lira from Ukrainian prison.
100 T90m per month. Add in refurbished T72 and T80 tanks     - that's a lot of modern battle tanks to contend with.
I heard that the Russians are currently reducing the bridgehead!
Ukrainians are fighting on both sides!
Stalemate - that's a load off - we can all relax now😮
What's happening on the battlefront? Is it a stalemate?
YouTube channels like Weeb Union provide up-to-date information on the battlefront.
I'm really confused. If Avdivka is not operationally important, why did Ukrainians defend it?
Don't forget Russian was running out of missiles in Spring 2022.
Ukrainians are fighting on both sides - from Donbas and Crimea.
31k KIA for Ukraine and 180k KIA for Russian - it's amazing how well Ukraine is combating the huge disadvantage it has in artillery in an artillery war when 70-80% of casualties are arguably due to artillery!
President Zelensky said Russia has lost 180k dead and Ukraine 31k - this clearly means Ukraine and NATO are winning the war - it's obvious.
Ukrainians are fighting on both sides!
Where is the video evidence for meat assaults?
I didn't realise Western Ukraine and NATO are doing so well 😊
It doesn't fit the pro-Ukraine narrative😊
I'm confused, how could the hydro plant be hit by 8 missiles when Western Ukraine is routinely shooting down most incoming missiles?
Why so much emphasis on the targeted Ruski landing ships when arguably more significant events are happening in Donbas?
What's actually happening on the ground on the front lines?
450k Ruski casualties? Really?
President Zelensky declared 31,000 Ukrainian KIA... why then the need for more troops..? It's very puzzling.
I didn't realise the Russian and pro-Russian Ukrainians had such low morale - that's a load off.
Russian bomber downed, Russia losing big - load off!
Russian has extremely low morale but keeps on advancing - adds up?
An army with extremely low morale advancing all through the winter?
British men love their women. One British guy dumped his cellulite filled British wife for a Ukrainian refugee woman he was hosting. 😅🤣😂
Ukrainians were killing ethnic Russians with guns supplied by USA and its lackey UK. Ukrainians are being punished. Some are being blown to bits, but most are being injured or killed.
From USA... we are rotting from inside. BLM, LGBT, illegal latinos are flooding the country. We (USA) just got picked out of Afghanistan by a bunch of beards. Our lackey UK is doing a lot in Ukraine. Just like USA, UK is also drowning in BLM and dinghy divers. We (USA and UK) are both trying to use Ukraine to distract ourselves from reality.
UK has a Indian Hindoo PM, and a Pakistani Muslim Mayor of London.... UK is a caricature of itself. But some in UK still think of themselves as a lackey of US (itself drowning in BLM and latinos). UK should be a lackey of India and Pakistan now
American people are salivating for Ukrainian mail order brides.... cheaper  because over supply
"latest: Biden refused send his personal money to Ukraine. Hunter refused to go fight in Ukraine. Aavdivka, the last of the forts that NATO built in Ukraine to harass Russia has fallen. Ukraine can no longer kill ethnic Russians in Donbass. 
1 Million Germans surrendered to Russia in WWII. Now Ukrainians are learning how the Germans felt."
"Ukraine is being punished for taking US guns and poking Russia. Previously, Uighurs in China and Rohyngya in Myanmar were punished for doing the same. 
Why Telegraph is so anti-Russia and anti-China is the real question. Is it owned by Jewish people?"
"Don't drink the koolaid. Russia is just punishing Ukraine for taking US guns and poking Russia. That's all. Russia is winning. It will soon be over. 
Meanwhile, UK has a Indian Hindoo PM, and a Pakistani Muslim Mayor of London. UK is rotting from inside. US is being gutted by the Democrats with BLM, Illegal Latinos, Homeless and opioid addicts. Worry about these things."
UK has a Indian Hindoo PM (what caste?) and a Pakistani Muslim Mayor of London. UK should be kowtowing to India and Pakistan, instead of being a lackey of US. Unless Telegraph is run by Jewish people, who usually have their own agenda of hating China and Russia. Feel sorry the remaining White British people though. Must be awful.
"Ukraine took US guns and cash to poke its permanent neighbor, Russia. Ukrainians were naive enough to think that bribing Hunter Biden would make Senile Biden send in the marines. Truth is, Americans don't care about Ukraine... and if they do, it was because of mail-order-brides from Ukraine, who were cheaper but slightly less pretty than the Russian ones. 
Anyway, Ukraine is learning a very very hard lesson. Germans learned it earlier. US is subservient to Israel, Ukraine was just a fashion for a while. Its over."
"USA was created by White Christians who invaded, killed 12 MILLION Native Americans. USA still exists, no one blames the invaders. 
Does this woman consider the crimes of the White Christians committed against Native Americans OK? After  how many years does she consider it to be OK?"
"West is the definition of Moral Decadence. Look up history. It was White Western Christians who invaded America and killed 12 Million people to create 'USA'. It was UK, the lackey of USA, that supplied African slaves to USA. US supported dictators in Saud, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan, Egypt routinely kill people for asking for Democracy. Egyptian military under orders from USA killed the Democratically elected leader just a few years ago. USA and lackey UK were fine when the Saudi dictator had Khasosgi killed off. 
... Trump did not start any wars, Trump did not bomb civilians like Biden and Obama do. Kremlin's history, like that of China, is pristine compared to the history of invasion, rape, force-conversion done by the 'West'. 
Fortunately the West is rotting from inside. UK has a Indian Hindoo PM and a Pakistani Muslim Mayor of London. Democrats are gutting USA with BLM and Illegal Latinos. Russia and China are strong and getting stronger. Their clean history and civilized strength is being celebrated by the world as the 'West' becomes weaker. Morally decadent 'West' is finally being neutered. Celebrate. Or line up a therapist."
UK has a Hindooo Indian PM, a Pakistani Muslim Mayor of London.... UK should be kowtowing to India and Pakistan. Somehow, the Telegraph has not been out in the streets in London lately. Telegraph still thinks UK is a lackey of USA, and therefore, somehow, relevant in the world.
French weaker than Germans. Germans weaker than Russians. So says history. The Russians will make soufflé out of the French. Unless the French troops are mostly immigrants, Muslims etc. That could be different. But if they are white catholic French, they are 'surrender monkeys'
Americans are salivating for Ukrainian mail-order-brides. They are more plentiful now after Biden's cash and guns got lots of Ukrainian men killed.
USA forced him to go back. Navalny is essentially is on US payroll. US is not going to pay him if he is outside Russia. So the poor guy had no choice but to back to Russia. He earned his CIA cash by paying for it with his life. I do feel sorry for him.
Ukraine is being spanked for taking US guns and poking Russia. Vladimir Zelensky is not a leader, he is just a US puppet who is getting Ukrainian men killed so that there will be more women mail-order-brides for Americans.
"Germans did. 1 MILLION of Hitler's best surrendered to Russia. Meanwhile, Americans ran from Vietnam, Afghanistan... senile Biden is busy gutting America with illegal latinos and BLM. 
Ask Germans what they think of getting spanked by Russia. 70% German deaths happened by Russian bullets/bombs. Had it not been for Russia, Germans would have liquified the Normandy landings of US and lackey British."
"The British call the French ""Surrender Monkeys"". They surrendered to Germans without much fight. And Germans surrendered to Russians. 
French Surrender Monkeys against Russia will be too cruel, and funny at the same time as Russia would liquidate the French."
USA is drowning in inflation. Much worse than Russia. Pro-Democrat media censor the news to protect senile and smelly Biden.
UK has a Indian Hindoooo PM, a Pakistani Muslim Mayor of London... UK should be kowtowing to India and Pakistan instead of being a lackey of USA. The Telegraph still pretends to be the news for the 'empire', but UK is a third-rate country now. Get real.
Alfred Nobel was the biggest arms merchant at his time. Swedish canons powered by Nobel's gun powder, killed millions. Clever Swedes cover it up with the 'Nobel' peace prize, claim it is funded by dynamite (it is funded gun-powder, Bofors canon etc). Sweden joining NATO means nothing, they are already deeply integrated with US-led war crimes around the world by supplying weapons and explosives.
A Hindoo is the PM of UK now. Hindoos run Google, Microsoft, etc. Hindoos are taking over the world! 😂
"to the last Microchip"... that is funny.
The White British specialist in Odessa who were operating the drones were bombed. Meanwhile, UK, with a Indian Hindoo PM, Pakistani Muslim Mayor, should stop being a lackey of USA. UK is rotting from inside. Telegraph needs to get real.

"Western" as in old White Christian Colonial powers? The people who enslaved Africans, sold them as slaves to USA, force converted native people into jesus-worshiping, plundered their land? They are all rotting from inside. Democrats are gutting USA with illegal latinos and BLM. UK has a Indian Hindooo PM, Pakistani Muslim mayor of London... why would any one want to invade this rotting countries? Russia/China/Iran do not have any of these.
His wife will be sent to fight Russia. Russians will be scared away by her looks. 😂
@@chrisviking7807US is the only country that has dropped nuclear bombs on 100% civilians, twice. USA is fine. Japanese are still subservient to USA. Nukes work. Ends wars. NO, there will be **NO retaliation**! US/EU have 20 times more people, packed in smaller area compared to Russia. And Russia has 3 times more nukes. Nuke exchange devasting for 'White Christian Colonialist" aka the 'west'.
US is subservient to Israel. WHy? Ask Germans, they knew. US doesn't care about Ukrainians. When Israel wants money, Biden drops his pants and bends over. Americans have no say in the matter. Americans are never asked if Israel should get money. So, all the cash Ukraine could get is now in Israel. Maybe Vladimir Z can ask Israel.
As nostalgic British propaganda. UK has a Indian Hindoooo PM, a Pakistani Muslim Mayor of London... UK should be kowtowing to India. But some 'white' people in UK live in the old days when UK mattered. They all work in Telegraph😅
From USA: WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT UKRAINE. Hunter Biden cares about Ukrainian women. But Senile Biden has not given a single penny of his personal cash to Ukraine. Neither will we.
NO, we are seeing 1945 all over again. Russians spanked Germans then, now Russia is spanking USA and lackey UK via Ukraine. And, like then, the spanking is hard, and Russia is winning.
From the United States, WE DO NOT CARE about Ukraine. Hunter Biden loves Ukrainian women, as do many others. But we do not care how badly Russia spanks Ukraine. Germans got spanked earlier, so badly that they because subservient to USA since then. Ukraine is learning a lesson. They asked for it
"UK is rotting from inside. UK has an Indian Hindoooo PM. A Pakistani muslim Mayor of London. But Telegraph still think UK is a world power and saving the world from Russia. USA is also rotting from inside. Illegal Latinos, BLM, .... Democrats are gutting USA. And UK still wants to be a lackey of USA. 
Telegraph should focus on the Bangladeshis in London, instead of far away Ukraine. But it is entertaining. It is amazing how Telegraph is still predicting that corrupt Ukraine will actually win against mighty Russia."
NATO = US colonies, run by Germans. Russia fired 800,000 missiles into Germany in one night, in WWII. Germans know this. USA and lackey UK don't. So Germans carefully avoid fighting Russia hiding under NATO, while USA and lackey UK keep making fools of themselves for not reading history.
It is quite unsettling that UK is still kowtowing to USA. UK has an Indian HINDOOOOO PM, A Pakstani MUSLIM Mayor of London. Indians/Pakistani's don't care about Ukraine. But the Telegraph is still pretending that UK is a 'white' country. Get real.
"Russia does not want to touch dirty Europe. Germany is full of Mosques. Paris has more third-world immigrants than white French. And UK has an Indian Hindooooo PM, a Pakistani Mayor of London.... Europe is rotting from inside. 
Neither Russia nor China nor Iran have any of these. Russia is clean, and getting stronger. Why would Russia be interested in feeding Muslim immigrants in Europe?"
Estonian PM should start her own OnlyFans or Patreon channel. I would pay her.
Germany is full of mosques. Streets of Paris are full of poor immigrants from India/Bangladesh. UK has a Indian Hindooooo PM, a Pakistani Muslim mayor of London. Belgium is full of Africans. Europe is rotting from inside. Why would Russia want to touch these dirty countries? Ukraine is being punished for taking US guns and killing ethnic Russians. That's all. Russia is clean and strong, Russia will not touch dirty Europe with a 10 foot pole.

Has anyone at CNN or BBC seen or heard from chief of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense Kyrylo Budanov over the past three days?? Reports have been coming in from multiple sources since Tuesday that a Kinzhal hit the Intelligence building in Kyiv and everyone in it at the time are dead.
Ukraine has lost 15 Leopards, 13 Bradleys, and 5 AMX10s and they haven't even come within 10km of the first defensive line. If I were Zelensky, I'd tell Biden and Sunak to go f themselves, and call up Xi and start talking the Chinese Peace Plan. Zelensky's first job is to save his country, not ensure his land is there for future NATO use. Once Ukraine's NATO attack forces is sufficiently weakened the Russians will pour out of these areas like a flood and they won't stop until they reach the Polish border.
FINALLY heard about Budanov today after two weeks of silence. The Kinzhal didn't kill him after all; he is critically wounded and was evacuated to Germany for medical treatment----he may not survive but for now he is alive. That was the strike two weeks ago where the Kyiv Patriot battery fired all 32 of its $4M missiles trying to stop the Kinzhal....and failed.
WHAT is happening isn't all that surprising for anyone paying attention (and not reading Western MSM only); however the TIMING is so bad for Russia that one has to suspect CIA involvement. Just this week alone: failed Ukraine offensive, UK passes law to continue sanctions on Russia even if war ends (victory for Russia), and rumblings in both Africa and China about "peace plans". ALL of that favors Russia; now this?? I smell CIA...
The Russian breakthrough area yesterday has doubled in soze today. Ukrainian defenses in Donbas are crumbling.
@@chrisviking7807 LOL. 500K Russian troop new mobilization too. 🙂 Sorry.
Everything was fine unitl NATO tried to destroy them using their own cousins in Ukraine. Why can't NATO just back off and admit it didn't work?
This report is 18 hours old; in that time Russia has obliterated an entire Ukrainian brigade attacking towards Robotnye.
It is time to negotiate. Long past time actually, but the offensive has been defeated. With no air cover Abrams will be blown up just like Leopards. A few F-16s are still months away and won't change the outcome of this offensive. Then its winter, Russians still sitting right where they are today, and rested with more tanks and more ammo. Armistice. Now.
How many NATO mercs killed this time?
@@anthonyhulse1248 "Morality" LMAO! Ok, "Joe Cluster Bomb Biden"!!
Yes, but it is purely symbolic. Even that warmonger Blinken admits "they won't affect the outcome of this offensive, and will only allow Ukraine to establish local air superiority over Kyiv's skies". Russia is more annoyed than afraid: 24 planes the Danes were retiring next year anyway, plus 18 more that have been up for sale for years. 42 planes like so many 2012 Kias on a cheap car lot. Against 800 Su-27s, Su-30s, and Su-35s. Ummm, yeah....ok. Another "game changer" burning on the Steppe like all the others before it ..
Wait, the Mighty Leopard 2 has been blown away repeatedly by $500 Lancet drones (33 confirmed kills so far, including the one on display in Moscow), and trash talk about a Russian tank?? A British channel too, when the Challenger 2 is STILL TOTALLY UNSEEN in battle?? As we say in Texas: "Ya'll are all hat and no cattle!"
I think that's about the same bonus the Russian soldier got for killing the first Leopard 2 a few months ago.
No video of the blasted and burning Challenger 2 near Robotyne?😂
Of course. They have Ukraine's NATO army in a pocket and the point is to keep them there in that 2 mile by 2 mile square and annihilate them with drones and 3000 lb guided bombs. Let's all pray that Russia is successful.
Yes, and I could be Emperor Constantine. The bulge in Robotyne hasn't gotten larger in about a week in spite of Ukraine pouring infantry in there every day. That means virtually every guy they send in there becomes a casualty. Russia sent a whole army from Kupiansk to Tokmak so the manpower advantage there that Ukraine had two weeks ago is gone; they now are outnumbered and they are on the attack----a recipe for disaster. This same "they could crumble" garbage from the Americans is what helped start the war; the believe "oh they're all drunks", "they are running out of missiles" , "they have only shovels" , "they will run away at sight of a Leopard 2". ALL myths blown apart.
Yeah whatever. This is almost 24 hours old and that line hasn't "buckled" at all, and it never will as long as Ukraine is using only infantry to assault it. They can't send vehicles because Russia blow every single one of them to bits.
Mil bloggers report that UK screamed bloody murder at Zelensky for using the Challenger 2s in Robotyne. Apparently Ukraine is only allowed to use them once they reach Melitopol so the Challenger 2 can be filmed by CNN driving victoriously into the "liberated" city. AFU will add some scorch marks to make it appear to have survived enemy fire. 😂😂
Smart. They hardly need it for what they are about to do to Ukraine. Can move them back in a few months when thet dirty work is done. 😂😂😂
Soldiers there = target. Just like the family coming from the beach on Kerch bridge, right? Fair is fair.
Ukraine's performance in this war will be taught in future military academies in the chapter entitled: "What NOT to do. Ever. Under any circumstances."
@@marisabenson1222 Maybe, but why would they? Their tactics since WW1 have resulted in crushing VICTORY for them two out of three times. Germany: W, Afghanistan: L, now Ukraine/NATO: W. Those are good odds...
Strategically, the war is over. Tactically they are still shooting at each other, but from a political standpoint its done. The political goal of removing Russia by force from 45,000 square miles of territory failed; Ukraine got less than 1% of the territory back in six months for loss of $200B. Zaluzhny confirmed such a goal is not achievable and would require massively more money and even  then there is no guarantee. Russia has no interest in occupying the rest of Ukraine; the areas they annexed hold the Russia populations they were concerned with; at this point Russia is simply in a "protect what we already have" mode. NATO failed to get what it wanted as the sponsor, and Ukraine failed to get what it wanted as the proxy. Next year there will be elections and Zelensky may not win; Ukraine may choose a different future than the one he envisioned.
MARA:  Make Avdiivka Russian Again
Anyone still here that believes Ukraine is "winning"??? LOL.
Ukraine Pravda reported that when Lloyd Austin visited Kyiv on Nov. 20th , one of the things they asked him for was "...17 million (that's right--MILLION) 155mm artillery shells" to be able to reach the Sea of Azov. They said he was very surprised as there are not that many shells on the earth to collect and he told them it is "impossible". AFU estimates they will need $350-400 BILLION to "restore borders to 1991 level".
Russia has moved forward since their offensive started on Nov. 7th and their washing machines fall like rain the past week.
So? US has had a Global Hawk flying over the Black Sea, giving Ukraine targeting intel for almost two years. All is fair in love and war...
Probably the clear crushing of the US aid bill (and the imminent fall of Avdiivka) made Zelensky have to act today. The 50B euro aid is spread over four years, half is just for salaries and pensions----the few arms in it can do nothing to halt the steamroller. The US $60B would have stiffened AFU capability through the summer, but like pumps on the Titanic, only time would it have gotten them. With that now out of the picture, even time they no longer have. The only resource Ukraine has now is men----old men----and they are going to expend them to whatever end.
...oh and in today's NY Times: "US admits Russian plane shot down by Patriot missile probably was carrying Ukrainian POWs"   Putin always wins.
Fresh forces sent in, eh? NOW, we know why Zaluzhny was fired; Zelensky wanted him to feed the grinder and he refused. So Syrsky gets the job and in they go. Outgunned 10 to 1, in they go never to emerge. No wonder 700,000 of their citizens who could fight will never go back.
My favorite part in all this is Newsweek prints an article Monday about how the "crack 3rd Assault Brigade" is going to Avdiivka, and by Wednesday we hear how they almost immediately came under withering fire, saw it was a hopeless disaster, and after taking a few hundred casualties they bugged out. Think Newsweek will print an update on their efforts next Monday?? 😅😅😂
"""About half of all agricultural land in Ukraine belongs to three large American companies Cargill, Dupont and Monsanto.""
I never knew this until a week ago. It partially explains why US Democrats are so willing to risk very unpopular immigration sentiment to send more aid to Ukraine. They are protecting their wealthy donors' investments"
Something that seems to not have occurred to anyone: Imagine what it means if Zelensky was serious-----if he actually believes this.
Clearly France was speaking only for herself. I'm sure the Russians are terrified...
I said "Russia is taking a lot of towns" and YT deleted it.
What really makes me laugh is that Nalvany's views on the Ukraine war are well known. He believed Russia and Ukraine are historical brothers and should not fight each other. That is *not* the same as him agreeing that Russia should be a Western vassal kingdom like Zelensky's Ukraine. NOT AT ALL.
Ukrainian Nationalists tried this in 1941 too. At first it seemed like everything was going to work out their way, but then the Russians did not break and the tides of war turned against them. 80 years later they are trying again; and again, initially it looked like everything was going to work out their way, but again Russia did not break.
I was born after Vietnam, so I've never seen the "global chessboard" up for grabs to this degree in my life. Nations and blocs are ALL behaving as if nuclear weapons were never invented, as if they can settle old scores and new ones with conventional arms only.
Germany looks really, *really* bad in this...
I'm so tired of this charade. How can Americans donate to the Russian Army?
Yep. Thats where the trail leads; where we all knew it did. Ukraine, and those who hold Ukraine's leash
That's why Zelensky "fired" him today-----he no longer exists.
LMAO!! Russia lost the vehicles *but gained all the land they were assaulting!* !  This is a war over *land* remember? US Marines lost a bunch of vehicles taking Iwo Jima, but they *gained all the land they were assaulting* !  I love to come to this channel once a week as the Cope is stronger here than almost any other place in the galaxy! 😂
Ukraine has taken 80,000 casualties in the first three months of 2024. No breakdown of KIA/wounded but using the "1/3" ratio typical of ground combat that means at least 25,000 KIA and 50,000 or so wounded.
Azov refused the order to go to Chasiv Yar. The End is near...
"Supreme Allied Commander Cavoli said last week that ""Russian army is 15% bigger, and far more capable and powerful than it was two years ago"". He finished with: ""Cavoli said in his written testimony that Russia is expected to produce more ammunition than all 32 NATO allies combined per year and is on track to “command the largest military on the continent...""
Good job, NATO. Solid work there ""weakening"" Russia. Your meddling has turned them into the most powerful force in the Galaxy."
A tsunami of steel is massing near Kharkiv and Sumy, FAB-3000 first confirmed use today. The hammer is about to fall.
Just look at what's in the aid and it answers all questions. No tanks, no bridging equipment, no SPGs, no offensive firepower at all. Just tons of 155mm shells, anti-tank/anti-air missiles, lots of IFVs, and the only "big stick" is the ATACMS but that's nothing new, just longer range. It is a package for an infantry-heavy army to DEFEND; that's it.
U$ sent 100 long range ATACMS, RU sends back 1000+ Tornado-S.
Meanwhile: RU takes two towns in less than 24 hrs...
That why IMF predicted Russia economy growth for 2024 by +2.2% … so stop spreading this false information that Russia really suffering….

When NATO illegally invade Iraq why then u people didn’t talk about rule base orders or morality.. why for NATO rule base orders is nothing but when it’s come any other country then u all shouting about rule based orders… do u know in our language in our part of the world we called it hypocrisy and double standard… that’s why NATO failed to isolate Russia… and do u know why buz of your own western leaders hypocracy… and this is the reality
This people talking about Britain 😂😂😂… they not even have sufficient tanks for themselves to save their own country.. they only got 150 tanks. 😂😂😂😂😂… seriously… If Russia attack UK now they can’t even save there own country alone… this is the reality.. so stop sharing propaganda and tell the truth to your own people…
Ohh yes ..your lies regarding missile attacks clear .. Ukrainian military infrastructure was destroyed and also destroyed sone Ukrainian airbase but u will not share that buz your prodcast is a full of lies and hypocrisy..  scared to talk about real information
Till the NATO prolonged this conflict it will not give any results…here come another Ukrainian liar in this prodcast 😂😂😂😂😂.. she was so over confident that Russia is nothing in front of Joker 🤡… year ago she said that Russia out missiles… no morale to fight … no ammunition …her joker 🤡 is winning … according to her Russia don’t have enough material for making missiles and ammunition… but her lies was exposed … she said that Russia was out of missile but seee after 2 years one missile or debre of missile defence system hit near by her house… this is karma 😂😂😂😂😂
Another information that your prodcast not sharing that zelensky is preparing 50k Ukrainian women to fight in battlefield.. see the situation… ukr is running out men’s and forcing Ukrainian women to fight .. seriously shame on that joker 🤡… all Ukrainian politicians are sitting in there lavish home and making comments.. why not they go to the battlefield..
And in battlefield news your people forget share important news where Ukrainian lost Vesele and Russia captured that place … and Ukrainian is moving out Krinky .. wrost situation for your joker 🤡 and his men’s in battlefield 😂😂😂
Those who oppose this proposal know that this conflict will not give any results… in last 3 years they understand this truth .. I m just shocked about one thing this so called people in this prodcast why never ever asked about oil Russian oil purchase from his UK government
I think your propaganda channel forget to share one important information in which Russian missile attack in Kharkiv dozen of French mercenaries… what do u think that if u don’t share those then world will not know ..do u know I feel so amazed that 30+ NATO countries news channels propaganda still not work in this conflict…😂😂😂😂… joker zelensky and western media thinking that hiding Ukrainian huge huge casualties will win this conflict 😂😂😂
Share some latest news 😂😂😂 .. that was happened on sat .. I think your propaganda channel don have that .. I tell u which hypocrites people like u don want to share to your own civilians… Kieve mayor made a statement in an interview that Joker zelensky authoritian attitude hampering our country… suppression of free media … ban on all opposition parties.. so now jokers own minister telling the same truth which Russia was telling many times about zelensky authority an attitude…another news which u also don’t want to share where Ukrainian airforce chief made a statement that it’s very difficult for them to hide ammunition from Russia and they easily got the information about those ……so open your eyes 👀 double standards attitude have to change
But your hypocrite Channels forget after this attack how Russia will retaliate hard which is very hard to save from that … and Russia will retaliate and that will more hard as usual
Stop sharing incomplete or information to the world… it’s not sink … who said that it was sink .. did u saw from your eyes or your joker saw it … it was damaged with that blast … so doing this buz your joker still can’t defeat Russia… and one more information which u hypocrites people don’t want to share with the world that recently US and Germany said that Ukraine can’t join NATO and in international criminal court they reject joker zelensky and his men’s claimed that Russia is a terrorist state and so on …
Why your channel is not talking about the information where one of the French investigation team found that joker 🤡 zelensky’s men used Patriot missiles to destroyed IL -56 .. using of western weapons inside Russia .. that means Russian was right .. which is not at all good for your joker buz Biden specially told your joker not to use there weapons inside Russia
Your puppet joker 🤡 zelensky saying lots of things from last 3 years but nothing is happening 😂😂😂😂
Hey your propaganda prodcast channel forget to share another big information which we got it from other countries news channels where Gorgia recent capture Ukrainian plan to bomb Russia.. they sized 14 kg explosive by SSG and foiled the plan to bomb Russia.. such a shame for your joker 😂😂😂😂
Your joker didn’t told that many Ukrainian military infrastructure has been destroyed
Joker wow to retaliate 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡😂😂😂😂.. after that Russia again kick him back 😂😂😂😂… tell your so called joker rather then think about retaliation go and worried about frontline
Your propaganda channel given news about Gorgia then why u people not talk about the sized of 14kg C-4 explosives from 4 Ukrainian who were trying to take into Russia.. either idiot people like u don’t know or don want to share that
Even after 2 years of this conflict I feel like laughing to hear from your mouth that Russia is vulnerable 😂😂😂😂😂… see the situation in Ukraine every got shattered… inn Ukrainian are suffering… it’s a joker who is vulnerable .. stop your propaganda and this will not change the result in this conflict..Musk is right that if anyone thinking that Russia will defeat then they are still living in a dream ….
This are the same who published in Ukrainian prodcast 😂😂😂😂😂… those time is gone where Russian army was weak … the more this conflict going on and on the Russia is getting more stronger
See how this ex US ambassador don’t even know how much % of land Russia captured 😂😂😂 and sitting in a discussion 😂😂😂.. Russia captured 20% of Ukrainian and after capture Aavdivka it will increase… so stop lies that joker or NATO can defeat Russia and come to reality
I love to see how dreaming to put Ukrainian in NATO … all this hypocrite guest don’t even know the ground reality what’s going onn … Russia will not stop till the time joker zelensky will not agree not to join NATO…
Another information which of course propaganda prodcast who don’t want to share your viewers that Putin visited a TU -145 bomber factory and fly on the new bomber .. so Russia is producing new bombers
This not the only information from the battlefield… as per NYT reports atleast 1k Ukrainian soldiers got POW in Aavdivka… so share that information also if u people saying yourself a journalist 😂😂😂😂
Atleast Russian counter offensive is not failing just like your joker zelensky overhyped counter offensive totally failed 😂😂😂😂.. so stop your propaganda and lies buz it’s not working from last 2 years ..the way u people doing your prod cast u all are become mock for other people 😂😂😂😂
He is doing jokes with that figure and now people are laughing 😂😂😂😂… we know that joker zelensky love to lies in different scenarios in last 2 years … so now people stop believing in that Joker 🤡 …
One for information u need to share with your viewers that Austrain chancellor said that no peace deal without Russia or Putin in his speech .. buz we need a peace then Russia must be present … so this is come from one of the NATO countries
I knew right from the beginning that this prodcast pe are hypocrites and believe in one sided but they claimed themselves journalists.. they are buz they think that by sharing one sided news will become great achievement but it’s not ..  people were laughing on them .. thus guys have that tendency just like sone western countries leaders to underestimate Russia but reality is different.. I just a saw a recent interview of USA army chief and he literally warned not to underestimate Russia.. according to him Russia adopted a changes very well in Ukrainian conflict and they are now doing well … according to to him Russian are ahead of Drones .. lautering ammunition … Russian defence industry doing well .. so this is the reality and atlast after 2 years people are recognising the fact that Russia is not Iraq or Libya …
Your team not mentioning about failed commando attacks in Crimea where around 20 elite Ukrainian commando killed in that sabotage attacks in 28th Feb … literally they thought that Russian will not notice but they forget they were waiting for them 😂😂😂😂… they used 5 boats and 4 boats were destroyed and one boats were run back 😀😀😀😀… I don’t know how come u people forget about this news … may be u people feel ashamed to talk about that
Why ur channel never publish prodcast of Gaza issue and killing of innocent civilians… why your channel never see that genocides and western hypocrisy… so your morale only Ukraine… so stop your propaganda and u all are hypocrites
U talking about railway bridge blowing but why ur channel is not talking about failed commando attack in Crimea in Feb 28th where 20 Ukrainian elite commando were killed….
I think your channels need to prepare properly before u published this propaganda prodcast 😂😂😂😂.. Russia is using millions dollars Iskander missiles which was destroyed sea drones warehouse along with killing of some Ukrainian elite forces there … if Russia want to kill joker zelensky then they probably kill years ago .. so I think your preparation for this prod cast is a joke 😂😂😂😂😂….
Macron can’t do anything mark my word he just bluffing 😂😂😂😂😂… Russian will kick his mens if they went to Ukraine to fight against Russia
British defence 😂😂😂 who don’t even have enough ammunition and soldiers to fight 😂😂😂😂
Sham election 😂😂😂😂… only western countries those who have an issue with Russia they are calling sham election big rest of the world never said that … more than 100 independent journalists was there in Russia to monitor this election from different part of the world including some from western countries… so stop your own agenda it’s not working my dear liars 😂😂😂😂😂
See again underestimating Russia.. this is why NATO cot failed to stop them in last 2 years .. there this attitude make Russia more stronger time to time …. Glide bombs making hell for clowns men’s in battlefield… British army 😂😂😂😂 plz don make joke here … there own top notch tanks are getting stuck in Ukraine 😂😂😂😂😂… deterrence nuclear missile test failed twice and fall into sea after its launched from submarine.. so we know how UK is doing .. world is not fool

"But wait I thought these tanks were supposed to be game changers for 🇺🇦 😭🤣🤣 anyways God bless and protect Russian warriors"
Where is Ukraine counteroffensive? Ukraine 1millon men are hidding in the forest they will counter attack in 2050. Ukraine is a terrorist state car bomb prove it again.
Its obvious ukraine Will not be lounging a large scale operation their strategy is diferent check other sources
Screw Ukraine
ukraine winning this war yes the proper gander war. but losing the real war by some distance. is this a comedy show.
Ukraine regime is so strong that they keep retreating. 😆 🤣 😂 please send more weapons and don't forget more cash. We need to buy more mansions in America 😆 🤣 😂
Nagging in the back of my mind is does the west prepared to supply the weapons Ukraine needs to win this war or are they giving them just enough to keep them from losing ?
all  bullshit propaganda.See RT for real news.Guy is a fool.Get the history of DONBASS in the last 10 years on RT.
Buy a blanket and use it to keep warm and stop financing Putin's war.
It seems like Putin is advancing with a slow paced. He will conquer all Ukraine by the end of 2023.
Who is suffering from sanctions?
Great eulogy from Putin, the rest of the world will discard her memory to the dustbin of forgotten history.
The west promised to crush the Rouble to Rubble...give us updates on how far this has gone
The EU is a victim of its own BS protectionist beucracy.
So Germany being cut off from Russian energy resources means that they’ll be competing for, and driving up prices on global markets, but China redirecting their demand from Middle Eastern oil to Russian sources won’t have an at least partially offsetting effect…right.  A significant amount of what’s being cut off from Europe is natural gas, which can’t easily be sourced elsewhere (as pipelines are static, and LNG can only substitute for some of the cut off). That means that the remaining shortfall will be petroleum, which is fungible. The oil market is a global commodities market - Europeans can buy what China is no longer purchasing from the Middle East.  Bottom line, global demand is only growing slowly, while supplies remain constant, and could increase suddenly if a new nuclear deal with Iran opens global markets to Iranian oil.  This whole story as reported is largely “heads, Russia wins; tails Europe loses.”
This country and the rest of Western Europe can not go on like this, they have to swallow their pride and make peace with Russia on Putin's terms because he holds all the cards. The alternative is a total collapse in social order and violent revolution because, if he so chooses, Putin could drive up inflation in countries like the UK to truly unthinkable numbers.
The sooner people stop pretending that Ukraine is righteous or that they can win the better off we will all be. Stop supporting corrupt governments and their endless wars. Imagine poking a bear and then crying foul when the bear defends itself. Honk!
Western values are:  Invade a country like Iraq over a lie (that they had WMD, when they knew it didn't, but went ahead anyway), destroy the country, killed over 1 million people, and leave the country to fend for itself afterwards.   Now they're talking about sending billions of dollars to reconstruct Ukraine (because they are white and in Europe), not a dime from the NATO countries who invaded Iraq (Arabs in the Middle East), after they destroyed the country.
The inflation was created by the US/EU, when it sanctioned the Russian Federation, don't blame the war, blame the lack of good judgement from the western leaders.  Now own it!!!!
The Dugin's killing was a murder, and Ukraine is behind that murder according to sources.  NO PROPAGANDA THERE, nothing but the truth!  The one who is twisting this into propaganda, is the commentator on this channel.
More Western Propaganda!! Why not do a post on why this War started in the first place......ask NATO!!!
*Ukraine celebtates Independence from Russian monarchy and the USSR who have built and developed 90% of Ukraine and Ukraine celebtates friendship with Western countries who destroy Ukraine today with pushing weapons to Ukraine. What a shame. If Ukraine was against Monarchy of our Great Britain what we did? We did the same like Russians do today.  Huge respect to Russia from the UK. Russia will win.*
I feel so sorry for Ukraine that they have been caught up between these two capitalists monsters. NATO and Russia will stage many more events around the world for power, resources, lands, markets, and money for their products and services. Collectively the capitalism and market economy will remain number one threat to global peace.
Ukraine is losing and zelensky knows it but he will asked to carry on by the US
The bomb was ment for Dugin. And if this had been the FSB doing the same op in Kiev, theyd call it what it was. A murder of a journalist. But since the journalist was working for the russian side, it was just something that should scare the Kremlin. Murder if its one of ours, if its one of them, its fair game
This horrendous nuclear threatis thanks to american meddeling. What right does the US have to involve itself in Ukraine? Firstly they planned and supported a coup against the democratically elected president of Ukraine. And then it showed total sisregard for the Misnk II agreements from 2015. If this had not happened if Ukraine had guaranteed to never join NATO. We’d have none of this war. Putin wouldnt invade a brotherly nation without these justifications.
Putins Regime? Always any government the west doesn’t like is a regime. Will the U.K. soon begin the Liz I want to use nukes Truss regime? What happened to reporting the news objectively and allowing people to make up their own minds.  Russia does not need this to justify the war in Ukraine. I note that the news from the front was decidedly lacking because Ukraine is losing everywhere which western media never reports. The west is also losing the economic war due to its own suicidal sanctions policies….all lamely blamed on Putin…..look at me pulling the trigger on myself but blame Putin, truly a pathetic narrative.
The Ukrainians are Banderites, during World War II they murdered several hundred thousand Jews and about 200,000 Poles. The Banderites are the former subordinates of Stephan Bandera, who was declared a national hero by the Ukrainian authorities. The year 2022 is officially announced the year of Stephan Bandera in Ukraine. Ukraine is occupying Polish territories seized by the Soviets after World War II. It also occupies the territories of Hungary and Romania.
It seems Ukraine supports Terrorism.
Your information is strange. In your opinion, the Russians are shooting at a nuclear power plant in which they have warehouses with war equipment, they have a garrison there and are working on disconnecting this power plant from the Ukrainian electrical system.  Thanks to this power plant, the Russians will get free electricity for about 10 million of their citizens plus for their factories.  This power plant accounts for approximately 20% of Ukraine's electricity needs. Without electricity from this power plant, the Ukrainians will not have light in winter.
This is Victoria nulands war
The chap repeating himself endlessly that Russia might be responsible for a nuclear accident fails to mention that it is Ukraine shelling the plant with western  supplied weapons and likely under direction from the West. The telegraph war reporting is only for propagadising stupid people, many of whom have praised it here.
Killing civilian using cowardly attack of unarmed lady will not help the Comedian president mastered by other cowards like Biden the "sleeping gringo"
While Russia is attacking from the east and Ukraine's Rada's privatization of Ukranian soil to the West or should one say sold to the West doesn't look good for the future of Ukraine....
I heard they evacuated Kiev. Is that right?
If Europe buckles Europe will win the war for Putin.
To the Russians ...they ain't fighting Ukraine...the are fighting NATO
Why do British people stutter and stammer so much?
Brainwashing bollox. Where the fukc is Ukraine 🤔
The Telegraph and Britain in general is completely delusional when it comes to this conflict.
I just wonder what will happen to this format after Russia has won?
Although never the intent, UN peacekeeping forces have ended up providing a protection  force for Wagner mercenaries while they go about their business across a swath of Africa. Many of the Troop Contributing Countries for UN missions are developing nations friendly to Russia and its war aims in Ukraine. And who is pays for their troops to be there? Well almost entirely the West of course. For historical reasons that have to do with the way the UN is funded, Russia and China contribute almost nothing to the cost of these missions. Despite what it may mean for many ordinary Africans, the time has come to stop funding UN peacekeeping in Africa while the UN exists in its current form.
The standard of the telegraphs reporting is the marriage of britains defence handouts and the regurgitation of what can only be described as Ukraines fairytale analysis of events on the ground.  I know many listeners to its  narratives hold similar beliefs and espouse, with reverence similar views but in truth it's quintessentially fake news. Many will tut at this and liken their intellectual ability to ferret out fact from fiction as verification  sufficient to confirm the telegraphs reportage. Time will, I think unveil a different story altogether. Just be prepared for the excuses or actual denial of facts that will surely come as part of the cover-up.
Is Ukrainian terrorist bombing of Donbass - combined with Western arms deliveries - forcing Russia to liquidate Ukraine? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeZk4gADeq8
Joe's comments regarding Boris J. were absolute rubbish.  Boris was elected PM of the UK, NOT UKraine. All he had to do to be popular in Ukraine was to be a cheerleader and call upon the MOD for advice on how to help.  As a PM, he has been a disaster! His lies, deceptions, corruption and lack of coherent policy can not be wiped away by him earning popularity in a foreign country!
So  why not have one strategy of getting reporters in Russia to compare to the average family of 4 food and transportation budget to Hungary, Germany, Italy, on the actual cost of potatoes, milk, bread, beer, beef, seasonal vegetables.
Germany lost its sovereignty and became part of Russia. German politicians are on Putin's payroll, and a state of Germany does not exist anymore.
So Ukraine commits an act of terrorism and our press rather than addressing this the British press talks this up as ammunition for the Russian regime. They have a history of this. The Azov have disappeared people for the past 8 years.
A good time to bring to attention the words of Richard Kemp in his 17th August article "UKRAINE ONLY HAS THREE MONTHS TO PREVENT A WINTER BETRAYAL" published in The Telegraph: "While Europeans have been blindly satiating their hunger for cheap Russian energy, for years Putin has been baiting the strategic trap for them to fall into. His funding, disinformation and agents of influence in the environmental movement have increased dependency on Russia, playing a critical role in preventing shale gas exploitation across Europe as well as Germany’s termination of nuclear energy, heavily influenced by green parties that arose from the Moscow-funded anti-nuclear movement in the 1980s."  We need to cast aside the Cassandra-like pronouncements of these environmentalist watermelons and get cracking on fracking, coal and oil extraction in the West. We cannot let these rebranded commies leave us beholden to Putin.
Johnston persuaded Ukraine not to negotiate a peace when they had a chance..6 months later thousands are dead infrastructure damaged...and Ukraine will be lucky if they still have a sea port when this all ends...In my opnion  Johnston will be considered a man with blood on his hands and revilled..a bit like Tony Blair
This is not journalism, this is propaganda.
Regarding India buy oil from Russia, this is all a geopolitical game, the US threatens India but does nothing ! Why ? The US is trying to push the price of oil right down as this was kill Russia in the long term, the threats to India are to plausibility to the demands for discounted oil. Discounts makes oil much less profitable for Russia. We need to look below the surface.
We have been told day after day by the ISW that Russia has run out of ammo yet the Ukrainian soldiers say something different
Viva Russia 🇷🇺
Ukraine is losing the war. Will the Ukrainian state be obliterated? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeZk4gADeq8
HAIL PUTIN 🌕 Second sun is coming.
USA and NATO are wasting time and lives
Russia is protecting the plant.
Victory to Russia
Evil's western are desperate and confused..
Russia already won
Surely Putin is just helping Germany to fulfil its mission to become Green. It's crazy that they've turned to lignite which is far worse than coal. Makes no sense. Cheers Stuart.
Brits……. Dont bother …. Nobody buys your narrative
Russia should stop bombing themselves at that Nuclear power plant with western Himmars and rockets.
Yeah let's blame Russia, they sanctioned themselves, they stop the nord stream 2 pipeline, they made the Euro almost weaker than the dollar.  Operation " BLAME PUTIN "
This channel is so unbalanced and bias which will not bring facts to the public to  inform decision making in stopping the war. The public is being deceived from knowing the truth in Ukraine, this is now journalism
Ukraine is a broken state. Being promoted up by the US and EU
Just a thought Why should putin spend money out of Russia' pocket to store his gas when the west doesn't even want to buy it russia and the Russian people aren't struggling with gas prices Instead of branding russia as the bad people surely we should realise that west is way to reliant on eastern materials and that this should be a turning point to a hopeful eventuality of being self sufficient and highlight how the western world leaders have not thought about there citizens
UK and Europe headed for disaster. People are not happy with a leadership that cares more about profiteering than people. Winter and strikes and more corrupt Tories will create chaos as people are left to pay huge energy bills thanks to 12 years of Tory mismanagement. The proxy war is failing. Ukrainians are being used by the West. The rest of the world can see that and do not want to get involved. Western barbarism ends here.
What  a hollow journalistic rag. On your feet or  your knees. YOUR SANCTIONS. Russias resources. To quote  Chuchhill  " some chicken,some neck" The blood of Ukrainian soldiers is on your hands. FREEZE IN THE  DARK
Every Russian have relatives who died in the war. Also  30 % of of Latvias population is Russian.
Ukraine have openly stated that they are trying to get the Russians out of the power plant....by boming them 'carefully'. https://youtu.be/_lAZ00357ls?t=230
Are we supposed to believe that Russia is shelling the the plant that they themselves are occupying?
“Independence” when being run by NATO from Kiev
Any games played are being played by the west, and the EU. Russia has gas, it has NS2 available, NS1 can be turned on fully  if the turbines are returned. The NPP is controlled by Russia, therefore any shelling must be from the Ukrainians., Russia would not shell itself. The West deserves all it gets.
Tearing down the statue is a symbol for the genocide against Russians that is now taking place in Europe.
They don't have time to mention that it's the Nationalists shelling the   nuke plant.
100% the fault of Biden and Johnson.
Россия Вперед!!! Победа за Нами🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺✊
Hasn't nato being training them since2014
Another piece of lie.  Ukraine has lost all its counterattacks in 9 places, with heavy casualties. RS has claimed 1.2k ukrainian soldiers killed while the ukrainian body counts stood at 812 in the fronts.  RS plans to take another ukrainian big city.
NATO military strategy has failed.... Now it's more understandable the NATO fiasco in Afghanistan ...
Reasons why the West is responsible for the war in Ukraine: 1. The West helped the legitimately elected President putsch on the Maidan with at least 5 billion US dollars and by paying Georgian snipers  2. The West covered up and is covering up the murders of the Azov fascists in Donbass 14000 dead 75% Russian-speaking people in Donbass according to OSCE. Since 2014, fascist Azov troops have been attacking the Russian-speaking Donbass  3. The West and NATO has moved further and further to the Russian border (even to former Soviet republics) contrary to their promises  4. US soldiers have been in Ukraine for several years and have no business there  The list is not complete....
1200 ukrainians dead with no territorial grab, i sure love these counteroffensive memes.
Which Media Outlet is more Controlled by the State Narrative?   Pravda or The Telegraph?  This war will end someday with a negotiatged settlement but The Telegraph and their puppet masters want the carnage of war to continue so the EU will run out of food and fuel, the people will riot, martial law will replace Democracy, all cheered on by the biased State Narrative.
3 words ( Comedian, Actor PUPPET )
American politicians stuffing their pockets with Ill gotten gains from the proxy war they’re running in Ukraine 🇺🇦
Just seen a video of several fields full of collums of burning tanks, and Russia is the side with more artillery, thousands of ukrainians sacrifices for a western proxy war with Russia.
What a load of balls.
what a load of tripe
Lies! Lies! Lies!
Fake news, as usual.
Weapons supplied by the USA government to Ukraine emit more carbon pollution and are more harmful than those from farmers. Farmers have gone bankrupt, agriculture has shrunk, there are fewer taxpayers, and more people are receiving welfare. Is it necessary to raise taxes again? The decline in grain output is one of the most important reasons for inflation. Should the government allocate funds to subsidize farmers, support agriculture, reduce grain prices, and control inflation? Is inflation the most urgent issue now related to people's lives?
Azov Google / YouTube Azov G7 supports Azov
Telegraph and West media circle jerk.  Ukraine offensive went nowhere. Those territories are being taken back.  Which is the bigger fool the one spouting nonsense or the ones who prefer to rely on the one spouting nonsense?    This was a preventable war. Sadly the average Ukrainian is paying the price for a lousy corrupt government and US manipulating a compliant lapdog NATO.  Europeans are also paying the price for their poor government and their fantasies not to mention the amount of rubbish propaganda spewed.  Reality is Europe has to live with Russia.   The sooner it comes to a common sense conclusion and understands this the better.  No point  reading rags like the Telegraph that continues to prefer fiction over reality.
I heard there is a cia helicopter on stand by for zelensky .. also how did a comedian end up with over billion dollars in his accounts
He says the Russians never say directly they are putting sanctions, they say that they are waiting for sanctions to be lifted to repair Nordstream ! They leave wriggle room.  They don't advertise all their cards.   They are far cleverer than western politicians who are bluster and vain rhetoric.
This will be a short-lived victory. Ukraine at the end will be a landlocked rump of a  state.
why are we bankrupting the country to pump money in a corrupt country ran by a clown ? WTF is the media doing cheering this on instead of asking WTF we getting involved in ?
Putins acceptable troop losses is 175,000 troops.  That is his #.  If he would lose 5 modern battle cruisers and 2 nuclear submarines, he might accept only 100,00 troop losses.  He is willing to accept 7500 tank losses and 500 aircraft losses.  If Belgorod and Crimea fell, this would hasten a negotiation.  He considers his battle to be against NATO.  Ukrainians he considers to be a proxy.
No one cares stop wasting our money on Ukraine, and stop the genocide of ethnic Russians...

Russia needs to get a grip on this quickly. They're still thinking in terms of an extremely limited Special Operation to de-natzify and liberate the Russian speaking areas of Eastern Ukraine. Thanks to the war hawks in the EU and NATO this has quickly developed into a proxy war: Evil Globalist V Russian Nationalist.
I used to think American foreign policy was evil,  (still do), but I always believed American foreign policy didn't reflect true American values. I'm wrestling with that and am currently undecided but getting close to changing my mind.   In 1994 Tonya Harding (American figure skater) destroyed (broke her knee) Nancy Kerrigan because she couldn't win fairly. Was that an anomaly or is that how most Americans compete? That's exactly what America is doing with Russia, Europe, China, and virtually every small country they deal with. If America can't compete, it destroys.  Everybody knows it and they silently support it. Remember when Pompeo bragged at a Texas A&M university that the CIA "we lie, we steal, we cheat,' ? Well that's not really news but what I found scary was how the entire audience laughed and applauded.   Americans seem to support cheating and lying and destroying anyone who might succeed.    Americans stopped their government in the Vietnam war.  Why have Americans not stopped their government from the continuous  regime change, invasions, sanctions, and proxy wars that kill and impoverish people every day?  So either America is not a democracy or the majority of  Americans are as evil as the CIA and their foreign policy.
zionist proxy puppet show
The evidence is....the Russian Federation could make similar volume of strikes every day for the next six months, based on stockpile. What is left of the Ukrainian armed forces in Eastern Ukraine will be annihilated in the coming months. These journalists who repeat the nonsense of people like the head of GCHQ, are complicit in the slaughter that has been going on. Ukraine is a banckrupt country on the verge of a catastrophe, being used as a proxy, and these people are aiding that. There are no voices in the 'West' calling for a negotiated end to this, and that means it will end in complete defeat for Ukraine....to the last Ukrainian, right enough.
After Brexit , telegraph has found another Ukraine war propaganda. Ukraine will be destroyed at such degre it won't be a reasonable people to call it again my country. It is not too late to go around the table to negociate USA proxy war in Ukraine.  We will be all loosers from this war.
This is ridiculous propaganda.  And, as usual, they start the story in the middle, forgetting the 2014 CIA-fueled coup which set up the current American/NATO proxy regime and the 8 years of shelling and the murder of 14,000 Russian-speaking Donbas citizens by the Ukrainian government.
Journalist propagandist liars continuing to push this war forward are all traitors to their own country and every country on earth. Ukraine will win, fight russia till every last ukranian, what evil, corrupt lying frauds and grifters. No integrity whatsoever. Prison is too good for them. Not just the lying presenters, the editors and most importantly the money they are lying for, the cause of the corruption, those funding these lies driving us towards world war three they most must pay the ultimate price. Dont die for quid pro quo joe's son's crack money, ukranian gas company director hunter biden got there with a biden quid pro quo impeachable corruption and now we attempt to defeat russia in a proxy war because russia wont go along with the world domination plan.
I am saddened to think of human beings suffering from so much privation and danger.  But I am not in favor of supporting what seems to be a proxy war.  The U.S. alone has spent approximately $80 BILLION on Ukraine.  How long does this go on?  War kills people and destroys resources.  Have we lost our collective minds?
proxy war, proxy puppets, proxy propagandists
what Russia is doing it creating the perfect sh#t sandwich for the west. Keeping western resources tied up in Ukraine for as long as possible is having an impact on the very countries that wanted to destroy Russia's economy. The idea is to weaken the west so badly that it can't proxy war again.
PEACE talks need to happen that’s what needs to be done ! Enough with this draconian war that is not only Russias fault also Ukraine has a lot to do with it and NATO and UN are not innocent at all ! And the Obiden adm is definitely at fault for this proxy war , Romania needs to stay neutral in this matter they are already helping by taking in the refugees! LIBERTATE 🙏❤️🇺🇸🇷🇴
These are not Ukrainian drones, but Western ones. This whole war is a NATO proxy war and it has been going on since 2014.
Reeks of Desperation 😢 This Proxy War should never have been started!
"First, shame on the civilized world and humanity in the 21st century! 
 As everyone knows, this is an unnecessary proxy war in Europe...., the real criminals and beneficiaries are very safe and happy with their evil intentions and dirty achievements.  So, instead of adding fuel to the fire, it is better for the civilized West to remain neutral and reconcile the brothers by bringing them back to peace talks and mutual understanding. 
 The civilized West must immediately stop supporting any form of bloody war and destruction."
and now a totally impartial and informative segment on behalf RAYTHEON and the US/UK weapons industry, enjoy being waxed with your own TAXES .... Jesus Christ they aren't even trying that hard anymore
It's a US proxy war against Russia. Simples.
So 6 Hymars at $3m each to $18m to kill 70 Russian conscripts, so $257,000 per casualty; at this rate to eliminate the 700,000 Russian Servicemen it will cost the USA $180 Trillion Bankrupting the USA .. So a pyrrhic victory if the USA can carry it out 'successfully'. Imagine being so stupid to think that a proxy war to bankrupt the USA is preferable to peace negotiations?!?
Cynical proxy war to weaken Russia and sell US LNG to Europe. First the US backed coup to overthrow the democratic goverment of Ukraine. Then 8 years of war in Donbas. Shameful act by US neocons.
NATO proxy war. Has Putin died of cancer yet?
The UK is currently experiencing strikes, a cost of living crisis, a refugee crisis and a strain on all public services.  But we can send billions to Ukraine apparently and take thousands of their people in, give them houses and money without a problem.   I've had enough of this proxy war.
It’s hopeless. WORDS are not going to win the West’s/America’s proxy war against Russia. We are going to be forced to acknowledge Putin’s paranoia about our agenda of regime change towards Russian ideology and their political system. No mater where, when and why peace talks inevitably come about Ukraine will end up loosing territory. The only alternative to that would be nuclear war.
"USA encourage peace talks? Pity they did not do this before western Ukraine failed to honour their agreements at Minsk to allow the eastern states to be independent instead of bombing the eastern states since 2014! Could it be USA are concerned about China's promise to support Russia if USA boots arrive in Ukraine? USA never learns. They start so many wars but win NONE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df33AdTR9b0

War mongers , Ukraine deffense is failing, no tanks will be sent but plenty of people are getting very rich off the back of this Proxy war, what a waste of tax payers money
As much as we side with Ukraine, what filters through is that misery is greater and greater, the economy is grinding to a halt, and the Russians continue to drive wedges into locations. As much as the Ukrainians want and use the weaponry provided by the West, it produces a Frankenstein logistical situation with need for training, support, repair, and supply of a multitude of specialized munitions, parts & etc.   I just don’t see how Ukraine alone can achieve more than a stalemate. And no NATO nation is going to put combat troops on the ground. For the US, it’s an opportunity for us to grind down an enemy in a proxy war by providing military supplies to Ukraine, but we must be careful nonetheless- China is watching ITS potential opponents in a war over Taiwan deplete their equipment and supplies in what is effectively a proxy war for them, in which China expends absolutely nothing.
That's weird, everytime i see the "msm headlines" in my feed it is all "Ukraine destroy x amount of Russian tanks, Ukraine capture 100's of Russian troops,  Ukraine this Ukraine that. Yet in reality they are getting the arse handed to them on a shiny plate. And we are handing over billions of out taxes to that thieving little midget.
The Ukraine soldiers are being wiped out. They have zero leadership they are riddled with tuberculosis and are on the verge of a revolt on Zelenskyy!! If Russia doesn’t kill them they are destined to perish from the cold or at the hands of there own government for complaining about it.  Russia is weeks away from trampling the Ukraine in to oblivion.   Zelenskyy is a weak puppet controlled fully by Biden/American war machine.  10% for the big guy will keep this proxy war going until the bitter end. Regardless of the innocent population of the Ukraine.
Surely all the money nato and US AND UK have given is ENOUGH FOR THIS PROXY PROVOKED WAR
MORE aid, for the USAs proxy war against russia!   Pathetic!
Laughable disinfo from Uncle Sam’s proxy war supporting brit$hit poodles.
This is a US/UK proxy war against Russia that the west has started and continue to fight until the last Ukrainian.  End of the announcement.
The problem with promoting a proxy War by the west ends with a biased perspective of the motivations of our so called enemies. Why no mention of the sacking of Zelenskys chief propagandist  who openly stated the recent cruise missile strike was in fact a Ukrainian shoot down by the national Air defence.  This podcast rarely tells the full truth.  How can the British people trust this source. We have no army that can fight fully committed before we run out of ammunition. Stop war mongering and tell the public about the Banderite ideology we fund  and support.
In other words this is a NATO proxy war. Thanks for the confimation from our man in MI5/6
So basically the west has goaded Ukraine into provoking Russia. And now the collective west is at war with Russia through Ukraine proxy. Thanks for confirming that 😅👍  what a clown world 🤦‍♀️
Oh stop!!  Soros admitted the U.S and Ukraine is fighting the Davos groups war.....👍💯
❤ Russia stay safe ✌ UK
Poland hate black people russia 🇷🇺 love  black people
Ukraine is losing.
Ukraine is losing.

All GLORY To PUTIN and RUSSIA 🇷🇺👍💪👍🇷🇺👍💪👍🇷🇺
Boring Ukrainian propaganda 🥱🥱🥱
Great Russia single handedly beating the Nato clowns with 20 per cent of their capability. Lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Anglo propaganda
In other words this is a NATO proxy war. Thanks for the confimation from our man in MI5/6
Ukraine is losing.
Ukraine has lost already. Germany can simply read the writing on the wall that the entire West wants to ignore!
Go Russia 💫😇🙏
Maybe the plan is to facilitate Ukraine being razed to the ground, to the last Ukrainian, and then taking a piece?
Lying propaganda from fascist UK
If Ukraine wins do they go back to shelling Russians in the East?
It seems that NATO military intelligentsia (aka, the US Neocons) is more willing to "fight" for Ukraine than the Ukrainians themselves.   Question: if Russia is really a threat to Western Europe like the BBC, CNN, Sky news make it out to be, then one WOULD think that the Brits, Americans, French, Germnans, Italians, etc, would all need to send in their own troops into Ukraine to defeat Russian troops.  That's what Vietnamese did during the Vietnam war, defend their country against a supremely superpower, and defend at all cost the Vietnamese did.  But it appears that Western Europeans and the Brits do not want to fight but rather encourage the the Ukrainians to fight but most just want to flee Ukraine.  I have always found it a little cowardice to encourage others to die for your belief.
Zenly🤡 didn't choose a truce and then have peace talks for Ukraine People ❎️ He was so afraid that he would be held accountable for his war decision ✅️
Russia robot victory_hand
zelensky a comedian!
Ukraine is losing.
Well done Germany 🇩🇪.  Don't supply any war machines to anyone.  Don't be stupid like Britain. while the citizens in here suffer our government stupid enough  to fund a comedian zelsnzky and his masters in the middle East
Zelensky wants world war three
Russia 🇷🇺💪 should used  mother of     devils on Ukraine
In the meantime Zelenskij who got his presidency through the support of corrupt ukranian oligarchs is busy building his own dictatorship but of course western idiocy doesn't talk about that. More tanks and weapons will lead to more deaths. Cease fire now! But that won't happen because that's not what the US and its puppets want. Ask yourself too, what is Blackrock doing in ukraine?
There is another narrative circulating  and that is the Russian missile was en route to a military infrastructure target when it was shot down by air defences located near the civilian residential building. Russias intention is to demilitarize Ukraine, not decivilianize the country. Civilians don't pose a threat where as a hostile military does so why would Russia lob a million dollar missile on a civilian target when it serves no purpose and would be a public relations setback. This report may be completely wrong but there is a certain reasonable logic to it. If the US spent 100 billion dollars looking after the welfare of its own people and not interfering in the domestic affairs of other countries by way of coups and proxy and not so proxy wars, US population would be 100 billion dollars better of with free schools, hospitals, affordable housing for the working American poor, US infrastructure like rapid rail and functional public transport systems and the rest of the world wouldn't be guessing who is the next country on the US list to destroy. God bless the vulnerable and poor in the US and we pray that at some point the war criminals who have slithered their way into influential government positions will finally behave like responsible adults and abandon the cold War paranoias that were beaten into them from childhood and see the rest of the world as potential friends rather than enemies to slaughter.
Don't ppl find it weird the Ukraine have made it illegal to have peace talks with Russia, we don't want the UK involved, the Ukraine is the most corrupt foreign money laundering operation in Europe, only globalists & the industrial military complex want this war😠
No German national interest is served by this proxy war so ultimately the choice is: do your allegiences lie with your own public and economy or with US empire. Better 'pipe' up with the right answer or whos to say what 'Russia' (lol 🤡) may blow up next
As far as those despot Ukrainians and Western politicians are concerned, this war will continue until all possibilities of screwing the West for ready cash have been thoroughly exhausted, and those lovely bags full’s of tax payer s’ money from U SA the E U and U K have stopped arriving..
NATO proxy war. Ukraine is a Deep State money laundering human trafficking swamp.
It’s about time NATO UK and the USA stopped pushing this war to continue its a absolute disgrace they did nothing since 2014 to stop the genocide in the Donbas region by the facist Ukraine army and then admit that the Minsk agreement was nothing more than lies while the Ukraine build up its army ready for this this is a complete disgrace by these evil psychopaths
WE SHOULD NOT GET INVOLVED IN THIS ,RISSIA AND UKRAINE HAS BEEN AT WOR FOR MORE THAN 200 YEARS ,WHY GET INVOLVED NOW , SETTLE FOR PEACE , THE USA PUT A PUPPET IN CHARGE , ITS COST EVERYONE DEARLY ? UKRAINE HAS SOLD SOME OF ITS ARMS TO CHINA .WE DONT WANT OUR TANKS SOLD TO CHINA
West will fight till last Ukrainian, we know that since the beginning, but when nuclear weapons start hitting London, Berlin and Paris, I am wondering what song this idiots will sing.
Victory belongs to Russia .  .
Why is the West pouring so much treasure into such a corrupt country?
Ukrainian wokeism this is why I support the the Russians Slava Z'Baby
How much more Ukrainian's blood does The Telegraph want to be spilled? In supporting the escalation of the US/UK/NATO war by proxy against the Federation of Russia your are a gravedigger of Ukraine and in Ukraine. How disgusting the British press has become! 🤮🤮
Playing into the comedians hands WW3 hear we come
What complete Bullshit propaganda
Stop the War
War mongering west determined to start a nuclear war. Truly evil
AMERICA IS SETTING UP EUROPE FOR A FALL.! USING NATO TO PROVOKE A WAR WITH RUSSIA.! GO RUSSIA FU#K EM UP GOOD AND PROPER.!        🇬🇧❤️⚖️❤️🇷🇺
More scrap metal for Russia to recycle - SLAVA RUS
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺💕💕💕 Россия Великая держава! ❤ с нами Бог 🙏🏻 ! Нацисты мира будут уничтожены ! 💪🏻🇷🇺
I hear a lot of hostility toward Russia\Putin. I hope someday your radio broadcast can have someone from Russia's point of view on the show. Why is there such a sentiment that the Crimea should go to the Ukraine?  Is not the main language there Russian and didn't the peoeple vote over 94% to rejoin Russia as they were part of until 1954?
Putins lancet system will blow the english yankee and german tanks to bits lol slava russia from all the true Irish☘☘☘ the wee non christian puppet comedy  actor zelenskyy and lying Boris will be  in deep dung lol
West has no Locus Standi (neither as NATO, Nor EU membership of Ukraine) to support Ukraine. They are waging a proxy war by conspiring with Ukraine. West will make Ukraine a desert before giving them NATO membership.
Germany scared of Russia
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Ukraine is losing.
Countries would do well to start distancing themselves from the lunatic US policies.  The coming war with China is aimed at one thing and one thing only.  To contain China and stop them competing with the USA to become the worlds no1 superpower.  Instead of embracing China and working with them in the name of peace of prosperity for the world the USA would rather stir up world wars causing millions of deaths just to ensure they get their way, instill their agendas on the world the same way that they instigated this war in Ukraine and many wars before it.  The USA are going to cause an armegedon of they carry on with this lunacy!.  The world  needs to stand up and tell the USA enough is enough ans help bring an end to this proxy war  !
IF NATO wants Ukraine to win they should not just send tanks but send troops... its more efficient and not waste time and money and equipments.. this is a proxy wars between US and her NATO puppets ... its cowardice to use Ukrainians to fight NATO wars against Russia...
The westoid propaganda machine is now in cope mode and preparing their audience to accept another huge defeat for the ukronazi minions in Bahkmut. I wonder what kind of excuse will they use this time.
Clown Western world is losing badly. 😂
The Appetite of Ukrainian regime to demand fight jet, heavy weaponry is irresponsible and dangerous and only result the escalation.  The #UN, the #EU, and tge #USA support the talks rather than adding fuel into the conflict.  The Zelensky regime demands are too much, too higher, and unaccountable.   All the money is going unaccounted, and Europe is taking the burden of refugees and paying cash at the  same time.  And, now, the Zelensky regime — also demands from IMF. Where is the transparency, why WE as tax payer pay for the Ukrainian war.
If we had the same effort to talk about this war at the very beginning in 2014 when the EU and the US were funding a coup in Ukraine to toppled a democratic elected Ukraine government, to install an even more corrupt one, that banned the Russian language and commited massive killing in the Dombas region, wich our media choose not to tell people. This war started in 2014.
Go Russia 🇷🇺
American hedgemony going down the pan with their lap dogs economies 🇬🇧🇷🇺
Ukraine is losing.
Great Russia and great Putin
Nothing but West propaganda! In several weeks the Ukraine will be surrendering! My guess is Russia will take half of the Ukraine back for good! Next time maybe the Ukrainian government will tell the NWO to F- off!
The war is over, though battles continue. Ukraine is on the verge of absolute collapse. Western media coverage has been disgraceful. Goebbels would have provided a more objective version. It is time, well past time, to make peace. Next will be a major Russian offensive which promises  further destruction and despair for the suffering Ukrainian  people. Then again, perhaps we in the west should continue supporting the conflict until the last Ukrainian dies and their country is little other than a wasteland. Such bravery and fortitude.
VICTORY TO RUSSIA 🪆
Minsk agreements - Overall that is the Russian issue for talks. The starting point. Can msm address the Russian perspective? Did Angela Merkel admit Minsk was a ruse???? USA $$$ funded a military build-up. AZOV, Donbas ?????  How did Russia react to this after 8 years? Fellow human beings resorted to conflict? Is it possible the conflict was provoked far enough to justify? Is this a humanitarian SMO that has escalated in to war? By both sides? Sanctions, SWIFT, price caps, NATO goading  - Is Russia a target.   Ask and report on the Russian issues? Try "Jeffery Sachs" Who writes a law prohibiting talks with the enemy? Who, honestly, blew up the NS pipes. USAEUNATO shun Lavrov (Indonesia) ?? Diplomacy?? US&THEM.  Are sanctions an unjust weapon? Do they work or cause suffering? This time causing a major trade disruption? I am not pro- anybody ------- I am anti-USA. ya UK too.
Ukraine is losing so badly, all these post pubescent echo boxes can do is insult the dead.
Why was nothing said or done when  the Ukraine nationals  refused to honor the Minsk accords - and we learn that they had no intentions of honoring them, but instead, bombed the ethnic Russians in a genocide.  Zelensky gives those of us in the West no accounting for the billions of tax dollars we have given.
PRO UKRAINE PROPAGANDA.🤔
I cant see how this ends other than world war 3 and the use of nuclear weapons . This is a proxy war between USA and Russia. ...America is the only country to drop nukes on citys killing women and babies killed 3 million Vietnam killed millions in Iraq Afghanistan Libya and Syria. They have assassinated all sorts of leaders and its all about power.   Nato was / is a defence force . When russia takes Ukraine public opinion driven by media outrage will give nato the excuse to get involved.
Good, the West is using Ukraine to attack Russia, or rather America is. The West has refused to go down the road of peace. Boris thwarted the peace talks in March22.  Russia simply wanted to protect its own people from persecution since 2014. Ukraine almost the most corrupt country in the world and suddenly we are all meant to support it.  The West made the Minsk agreements a farce. I am sickened by the way the West is engaging this horrific loss of life so America can be the sole power in the world and plunder the natural resources, thats the truth of the matter.
5:35 Zelenskyy was elected on the promise to not just root out corruption but to improve relations with Russia. His participation in the false Minsk peace talks which were designed to buy time for him to prepare for war with Russia proves that he betrayed pro Russian Ukrainians who voted for him.
Ukraine is losing.
*'We will never lose. We are strong. Nothing can beat us, we are the SS 'Aryan' EU Krainians!'* In WW II we fought WITH the Germans. Now we do so led by those nations who like us also fought in WW II as SS volunteers, to exterminate the Slavs and Jews, just like Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia and Finland did. For we Banderites Adolf was the good guy. How dare Russia defend itself!! US backed anti democratic regime changes are great for eternal wars. 'Eternal Wars' are 'good for business'. As Bell End Ski said, We LOVE Blackrock, Westinghouse and Goldman Sachs!!
"Ukraine is losing the War — The New York Times: The United States’ recent promise to ship advanced M1 Abrams battle tanks to Ukraine was a swift response to a serious problem. The problem is that Ukraine is losing the war. Not, as far as we can tell, because its soldiers are fighting poorly or its people have lost heart, but because the war has settled into a World War I-style battle of attrition, complete with carefully dug trenches and relatively stable fronts. 
  Such wars tend to be won — as indeed World War I was — by the side with the demographic and industrial resources to hold out longest. Russia has more than three times Ukraine’s population, an intact economy and superior military technology."
Stupidity of the West is huge by discussion in open about armour supply quantity and most important time when and where this gives Russia 🇷🇺 easy planing what to do.
Ukronazi lovers
Slava tebe Bozshe ☦️🇷🇺🇭🇺🇧🇾🇷🇸 🌍 📿🛐🙏 Amin
Even though iam a fan of the channel, I most of the time disagree with your comments which I think is too much negativity about Russia. If someone listens only to Western media u will probably think that Ukraine is winning. Thank God we have other options to see what is going on. Especially all this propaganda from Ukraine the most corrupt country in Europe which I personally know about as I visited there a few times. U can do a better service for your listeners if u present a more balanced view and not wishful thinking. I will still listen.
BRAVO RUSSIA 🇷🇺
6500 Ukrainians dead in 30 days 216 men a day. 262 000 total dead 431k injured.  Lost territory 32 percent of Ukraine.  Ukraine is loosing .
Zelensky is a fantastic actor 👏
proxy puppet, proxy war
CRINGE… -5th most corrupt country in the world PRIOR to the war; sponging our tax-dollars while we suffer increased property and the threat of nuclear war. Nah!
Freedom WILL win. The Western regime of political correctness and forced multiculturalism will fall.
Freedom WILL win.  Zelensky and his WEF puppet masters will lose.
Really, Ukraine has been at war for 8 long terrible years, killing and injuring thousands of innocent people, Kiev bombing the Donbass region relentlessly committing genocide, after  the illegal coup by the US NATO UK in 2014 under Obama, another major war created by the Neo cons, has the US west learned nothing from the middle East disaster? . This is a US NATO UK cabal war against Russia, with Ukraine as a means to end, and are responsible for the thousands of unnecessary deaths in Ukraine., as one political figure says, we will fight to list drop of Ukrainian blood.
Ofc freedom will win. Russia win.
Russia will win this
"WE KNOW THE TRUTH WILL WIN".....SLAVA RUSSIA.
No more weapons. Peace talks now. This is disgusting.
Zelensky is bankrupting the world and still has no chance of victory. This could have been over if Nato attacked Russia on day 1.
Propaganda.  What happened about to Russia running out of ammo in 3 days?  What happened to Ukraine winning narrative?  Ukraine has lost 250k says ex Israeli president.   Any chance of doing some journalism?
Russia will win so bring on a peace deal not fighter jets
how much does mi5 provide for this trash propaganda
Well done Russia
All lies to cause war why  dont we see any of this happening zelensky is boyband/actor/comedian nato puppet real british public are opposed to every bit of this mongering the british government against its own people in every way it can these smiling  monsers in suits  do not represent the british ppl at all.. l
please report the truth.......Ukraine is losing
As a western European I hate watching everything collapse while this Khazarian pig funnels billions of tax money into globalist pockets. FOAD already Zelensky.
Not sure why the European regimes have become so sycophantic towards Zelensky, as he'll be heading to the United States to live after the fascist regime is toppled in Ukraine.
Russia ‘suffering unprecedented casualties’... By having Ukraine lose 9 to 1 Russian.. I guess Nato really wants to fight until the last Ukrop is dead. Poor Ukrainians not realizing they are but American cannonfodder in another American caused Proxy war. The EUssr should sanction the US for it's 80 years of illegal wars and warcrimes.
Until the Last Ukrainian...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Slava Russia...British liars! 😉
Russia is winning
America and England war Russia never provoked any war NATO started the war for their own benefit like every war they start in the world
Russia is winning. Why not report the truth?
Ukraine is losing.
Unmitigated NONSENSE. Ukie propaganda... Ukraine is LOSING and Zelensky is a failure, both as a thug and dictator. Russia is eating your lunch, boys. A war that didnt have to happen, but that DID happen because of Ukie intransigence..
Lol 😂😂😂😂😂 nato is failing in everything 😂😂😂😂 Z 🇷🇺 💪
The United States military rarely finds itself in a conflict,  that the general population of the West is wholeheartedly standing behind. Even if Russia was provoked, it doesn't now matter ... "the Russians attacked Ukraine".  That's the only information Westerners need to go all 'warmongery'. Russophobia does the rest.  To the media and population of the West... it's a righteous war. Many want the US ( NATO ) to make this a hot-war and attack Russia head on. They believe this is the 'right' thing to do. This 'perfect storm' gave the United States exactly the situation they needed. The US military will have to defeat the current regimes in Russia and China eventually,  this was the perfect time to deal specifically with Russia. The much weaker superpower first.  Neoliberalism needs Capitalism to spread unheeded. Unheeded by other political systems running amok. The US military is playing the long game of 'defeat by attrition' and/or hoping that someone,  will assassinate ( or depose ) the Russia president. This proxy war with no US body bags is a gold mine. They can spin this out for years... and the original 'righteous angle' will never fade from the consciousness of the public. The US are not going to let this golden opportunity pass by with boring old 'peace talks'.   The US are 'dealing' with Russia right now and won't accept anything but their defeat. And the placing of a pro-US regime in place in the Kremlin.
We should temper our enthusiasm and remember that Russia has a far higher tolerance for loss of life than we do in the West. The reality is that Ukraine may succumb due to sheer numbers without direct involvement by NATO.
USA and NATO will never win this war against Russia
Russia to me has always been on balance a force for good in the world. America before Truman was also a beacon of freedom and morality. So many of my relatives were killed by Slava Ukraina chanting banderarists. Only my mum survived Babi yar. It breaks my heart that we are supporting such a corrupt country.
Be glad when they negotiate for peace and repair Nordstream
May there be another 1000 years of peace, prosperity and might for Russia and all Russians. Long life, good health to Putin, a great statesman and true Russian patriot ❤️❤️❤️🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Still not talking about Nordstream pipelines. The US government commits a terrorist attack on a fellow NATO country
The widespread delusion in the Western establishments (including the press!) is amazing: "NATO is committed to a long term war in Ukraine". WOW! To the last Ukrainian indeed........Absolutely sickening!
God bless Russia and Putin 🙏🙏🙏
Hopefully the Russians will smash this ukrinazi puppet regime of the neocon US and NATO as soon as possible. And may the Ukranian people, regardless of their ethnic, language or religious background, live in peace again.
let’s be honest Russia can’t lose - if they are they will nuke
How to bring Countries down to their knees. ? They how many life’s lost and displaced. Why didn’t they continue with peace talk’s ? Who’s benefited from all this ?
👎 The Telegraph 👎 👍 Slava Z baby 👍
Ukraine is losing.
Dementia Grandpa visits his puppet grandson 👍🏽
Of course the West is responsible. Monke wanted banan and NATO kept it out of reach. Monke WANTS BANAN so war. NATO's fault.
Canada supports Russia. Z.O.V.
The collective West did start this proxy war.  Russia was lied to repeatedly by both the Biden administration, and the Pentagon.  If Volodymyr Zelensky would have enforced the Minsk Accords which were part of his election campaign in 2018 - none of this violence would have occurred in the first place.  This fighting, or ethnic cleansing (if your familiar with Bosnia 90's) has been going on for 8yrs. now where Ethnic Russians live in an area called The Donbass Region - which consist of 4 provinces: Luhansk, Donesk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson.  There are a total of 27 provinces in Ukraine, and it is geographicialy  roughly the size of Texas
The west on the side of the most corrupt country in history. Only to continue to pad there own gains.
Victory to Russia.♥️♥️♥️♥️
So Nothing about natos encroachment then? 👏
I look forward to the fall of the West! Time to get humbled westerners!
The Ukrainian troll farms are hard at work in the comments 🤣🤣
166,000 illegal migrants all unidentified all in expenses paid hotels in the uk and our stupid government encourages more here. This is important to the UK not a none NATO EU member
Of course the Wild West war crimes in the Middle East over the past 20 yrs have been swept under the carpet. Let's not forget that the first casualty of war is truth!
Some experts - LOL. You said the Russians would fold in weeks. I'm just looking at the Rouble vs the Dollar and it doesn't look like these economic sanctions are having any effect whatsoever. He's just selling his oil and gas to other parties. A number which is growing ever larger since the US blew up Europe's critical infrastructure and no one trusts them any more. Time to bail to the Chinese.
How people forget The break up of the soviet union and the warsaw pact. How Russia withdrew their forces and in moved NATO  breaking the Warsaw pact. I fully understand why Russia are battling against the globalists and their puppet governments
Propaganda bullshit and lies by the MSM always has been.
RUSSIA IS A BEAUTIFUL STATE 🇷🇺
Azov battalion, black sun insignia wearing militia .
The propaganda machine marches on,come on Russia! ❤
Who thinks this war was a act of Russian aggression 😂. Let me ask who benefits out of destabilising 🇷🇺 ? That would be 🇺🇸  and N.A.T.O.  America get to end 🇷🇺  dominace in energy . They get to bring out old weapons to sell to  🇺🇦  and also test new equitment and military tactics . They get to Bomb 🇷🇺   Nord pipeline and get away with it.   Why are they not talking about Ukraine killing P.O.W or using chemical devices ? Why are they not talking about Ukrainians wearing isis patches ?  The west are the propaganda of the🇺🇦 . 1 of 2 most corrupt places on earth only beaten by 🇷🇺.  Dont be a sheep wake up for god sake .
Russia 🇷🇺 love ❤️
🤣🤣🤣. Unlike all the western NATO brutal invasions these last 70 years. Fancy the west supporting a fascist dictatorship. Slava Russia 🇷🇺
Keep cheerleading Biden and the EU's narrative , pathetic warmongering Globalists.
The corrupt proxy war in Ukraine that my taxes are paying for will never have my support. Only NPCs and paid spamlemmings actually support this corrupt NATO/MIC/Biden nonsense
Russia not having artillery left is new even to the propaganda? Banderite fan club clown show meme info
Expansion of NATO is a big deal.  Is it as a big deal as overthrowing Yanukovic or putting bio weapon labs on Ukraine or better yet, Nordstream 1 and 2?  Time will tell
Putin is absolutely right. I am Swedish and I am ashamed of my government and that my country has become a vassal state of the USA. Glory to Russia!
amazing how much opinion of ukraine has changed  from 2 years ago, no longer the most corrupt country in europe?  magic
War criminals like Soros, Kissinger, Nuland, the Kagans and the rest of the neocons...
Who will try the Ukrainians for firing their weapons from theaters ,hospitals and peoples homes?Who will also try the British MI6 and the Azov batallion for the  Bucha massacres?
Ukraine is losing.
russia flag 🇷🇺🤝🇮🇳
The unpleasant truth: Zelensky is just a puppet in the hands of the United States.  it's a well-orchestrated plan by America and Britain.  it's an errand boy in the hands of the West, it's like a test tube in the hands of Colin Paul...
What really matters s hat this proxy war is put to a halt and lives are not lost anymore , All this bullshit about NATO UK and the EU wanting the best for Ukraine is nothing but a power game that costs other people's lives .If NATO wanted peace then why did they and Killer clown Borris go running to Zelenski and demand the talks to stop
There was nothing illegal about the invasion.  Indeed, Russia did everything entirely in accordance with International Law.  They attempted to get the French and Germans to fulfill their duty to bring Ukraine back into adherence with the Minsk Accords.  Those two WESTERN nations violated International Law in refusing to do so, aiding and abetting Ukraine's attacks on people they claimed as their own citizens.  Russia then gave the DPR and LPR diplomatic recognition, which is all that is required under International Law to legally say that they are sovereign states.  Next, Russia signed a Mutual Defense treaty with those two states which is very much like the treaty that created NATO.  The DPR and LPR invoked that treaty, which provided all the legal basis it needed to invade Ukraine, in order to stop Ukraine's campaign of military attacks on civilian population centers that over the previous 7 years killed more than 14,000 people, mainly civilians.  *STOP LYING ABOUT THE RUSSIAN INVASION BEING ILLEGAL OR UNPROVOKED.*  Whether or not the West approves of it, it is neither illegal nor unprovoked.
🤡👽🎈🎈👾🎈👽🤡🤑🤑🤑🤑 Afghanistan Vietnam Vietnam Afghanistan Ukraine is the most corrupt country government president According to the Centre for Research on Globalisation, much of the $53.7 billion that the United States plans to give Ukraine will be stolen in corruption schemes orchestrated by Ukraine’s military, oligarchs, and government officials.  On a side note, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s net worth is about $30 million. He and his inner circle also have their own network of offshore companies. These have in the past been used to buy expensive properties in London. The documents also show that just before he was elected, he gifted his stake in a key offshore company, the British Virgin Islands-registered Maltex Multicapital Corp., to his business partner, who would go on to be appointed as Zelenksy’s top presidential aide.
It's a shame that we don't have impartial responsible journalism anymore.  The fact that people are brainwashed by the narrative pushed by the North Atlantic Terrorist Organization members lying to us about the reasons for the conflict in Ukraine shows how shallow and uneducated the majority of our population is in western countries.  Unfortunately with the media owned by the war mongering russophobic morons that run NATO, people seem to prefer to continue believing the lies rather than learning the true history.
How about peace talks, Russia ain't going to leave the Ethnic Russian people in the east, they have been dropping bombs since 2014 in the Donbas...
No mention that Putin had to save the slaughter of Russian speakers in Ukraine had killed 14,000 at the time of the so-called invasion.
A bunch of one-sided narrative,  Washington poodles, geo political propagandists, chew the cud.  Here in the real world, he we are much more concerned with this geo political virtue signalling, resulting in Taxpayers money going to one of Europe's most corrupt puppet regimes.  As the self destructive sanctions affect the UK more than Russia,  none of our criminal political class and liberal elite think about the moral obligation they have to the British people.  Instead, they oversee the demise of this once, great country deliberately, mendaciously.  All of them are on the wrong side of history.
The Ukrainian army and Banderite militias ARE who have and continue to commit war crimes far, far above anything the Russian army, the local militias of the Donbas or the Wagner group may have done in the fog of combat. The Kiev regime, a wholly owned subsidiary of the US and its pack of poodles NATO is wholly corrupt and responsible for cratering Ukraine's economy, posing as a "peace" administration and rocketing/shelling CIVILIANS of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia oblasts for 9 years! Russia will win this conflict, Ukraine will never return to the imaginary borders pre-2014 and one can only hope that justice will prevail and that those responsible for atrocities during Russia's Special Military Operation will be prosecuted and punished.
Why did Zelensky attack for years the ethnic Russians in Donesk region? Why allow Nato advance? Ukraine has bio weapons labs and will allow nukes on Russias border. Crimea was always Russian
Now the telegraph are saying that Putin intended to install a puppet regime at the beginning of the war: I suppose is too much to expect the telegraph to have any evidence for this (and no, I don't mean an anonymous state department source)
Why no reporting of the role of the US and Norway in the Nordstream pipeline bombings, as layed out in detail by Pulitzer Award winning investigative journalist Seymour Hersh..?
Fake news no 7: "we're in this fight together" as if the UK people support a us/uk proxy war
Ukraine is losing.
slava russia
Well Sorry but no. Zelensky is Not a hero. He is just a puppet of USA. This war is an atrocity since all points of view. Three principal actors to feel shame since now and for ever are Putin, Biden and Zelenskyy. To hit first, to hit back and to help others to hit is not a solution, no human life should be wasted for those leaders and for no one. If they want riches or democracy or other kind of desire, so put Putin in front of Biden and kill them selves, but not send the husband of my friend or the brother of my exgirlfriend, or the father of my sister daughter. Stop using people as munition, that’s not right. Stop defending sides and stand up against all leaders pro war. And the woman writer is just a funny person.
The west is willing to fight to the last Ukrainian.
More MSM propaganda.
over 80% of the UK think Russia is winning this "WAR"
The folly is on the west's part. What we are witnessing is the demise of American hegemony;the de-dollarization of the world and the destruction of Ukraine as a viable country. We are also witnessing the birth of a multi-polar world. Five centuries of western domination is over. Russia is winning the war. "The Telegraph" should really stop its propaganda and tell the truth for once.
No one cares about the evil war mongers who are Ukraine who broke the Minsk agreement…dirty extremists, obama and bidens war since 2o14 never forget the history people wake up
Its NOT an Invasion - its a Liberation of the Ukraine by Russia ! That Criminal NATO Puppet Zelenskyy must be removed and Jailed !

Telegraph is one of the propaganda machines of the Western politicians. Don't forget that Russia lost nearly 27 million people to defend their fatherland in 1940s. Russia will absolutely win this proxy war regardless the presence of western soldiers under the umbrella of volunteers.
I could imagine what's happened when Great Russia announce the war instead special operation against fascist Ukraine and NATO...🇷🇺💪✌️
Very biased and anti  russia...
1-3-23 ! Zelenskyy = Bakhmut - never heard of it - were is it - ha !!!! That Criminal NATO Puppet Zelenskyy was sending Young Ukrainian Soldiers into the Russian Meat Grinders - Time and Time again - he is now running out off Men Power !!!!  The Loop - the "KESSEL" is closing on Bakhmut and NO they are NOT withdrawing - they are trying to escape - few will make it ! Glory to Wagner - Glory to Russia - well done indeed !!!! ***THE BEAR IS ROARING***
Ukraine is losing.
Western military and propaganda spending will dry up precisely because this proxy war for corporate profit does NOT coincide with our values.
When the truth will out,and the ignorant see the lies and propoganda, will they them selves the bias media hand p45 out and walk the road of shame,will your pay justify the harm injury and Loss that have been caused? for my self as an English man, im ashamed the land  gorn upon, these criminal corporate treasonus liers, pay the ptrice and we the awakend are alive to see the NWo crushed under their own lies,from 15 minute cities and suporting the wrong war mongering criminals are they not?

Ukraine is losing.
Slava Russia 💪😎💗
RUSSIA ALREADY TAKE THE BAKHMUT
Ukraine has lost. They should get to the negotiating table asap and stop the bloodshed.
Putin is the Best ....Slava Russia 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺💪💪💪
Stop the B.S.   Ukraine is one massive proxy war lie, and laundry machine for corrupt politicians.
What a load of halakha from the pro war mongering telegraph.  Black is white white is black, crap journalism disinformation adding fuel to the fire. ❤ to Russia from UK ✌
"No one's gonna break us we're strong we're Ukrainians" Vladimir Putin" hold my beer' 👴🍺🇷🇺
satan-fascist-nato fkoff from Ukraine!!! zelehitler kaput!!! Glory to Russia!!!=Glory to World!!! 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Of course all demographic problems that Russia has Ukraine has got an even higher degree, all the more now after half their population has fled and their horrific, many times greater losses. Russia will win this war having to use no more than a fraction of the forces it mobilized (most of whom were called up to fight NATO should NATO continue to be criminally stupid, not the Ukrainians), hell, they are winning with basically the exact same forces they started out with right now. The European countries all have shrinking populations, including very much all of the Eastern European shithole ones that might be sufficiently suicidal and eaten up by irrational hatred to possibly allow themselves to be used as the next proxy by the US and Britain. Ultimately this war will end doing vastly less damage to Russia than to any puppet attack dog NATO might send their way, and it will damage NATO itself in a way that will buy the countries that actually are the future to prepare to defend themselves from the grasping hand of a dying US, NATO and Brit imperialism effectively (and from Russia's perspective it is nothing compared to the genocide by economic means wrought against it during the 90s by the western powers and their puppets).
Glory to Wagner, Glory to the Russian Federation 🇷🇺
professional western lies
SLAVA RussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussia
Interesting when the belligerents are calling themselves the victim. Let's not forget that highly corrupted and piss poor Ukraine has been invaded by the US and NATO as far back as 8 years ago. Even prompting a coup, led by the US with the help of Ukrainian fascists, that took down a democratically elected Ukrainian president and overturned its government, which immediately led to the war over Donbas and Luansk, making 14,000 casualties in 8 years. And obviously, we know London's position. LOL
Feeling sorry for all soldiers Ukrainian and Russian. BUT.... After "investment" of Billions dollars and coup in 2014, installing in pro western Puppet  "government", Ukraine is working for USNATO and Stock Market investors who support military Industrial Complex and for "politicians" who gets Bribs  and Incomes from them.  Pisxing off Russia is working, when Boomerang Law Applies, but they already know that, and European people also know.  G7 must get more "Income" from stock market "Investment"  ( Bulgaria got over $ Billion)  to pay for billing  Higher energy and new military equipment to feed Ukraine so they continue fiighing and dying to earn more money to buy wapons and Bribs, so they kill Russian and destroy leftovers from Ukraine, and bag for more 💰 is like "never ending story"....
Victory for Russia! Z
Hahaha hahaha 😂😂😂 how Bukhmut has gone from a strategic city to irrelevant and only symbolic. Don't the fake news propaganda artists understand we remember past podcasts? How they project what's going on with the Ukrainians onto the Russians. The Duran is the best, the Telegraph is the worst!! Slava Z baby
Russia victory_hand
Zelensky"s future looks bad
Ukrainians are being used as cannon fodder in a proxy war to bolster USA image. USA  do not care anything for Ukrainians or Europe in general, look at what they did to Nordstream pipeline. Painting Ukraine as being brave strong and heroic people is a joke whilst they  are being slaughtered in the tens of thousands. The West should hang their heads in shame. If not for the clown that is Bojo a peace treaty would have been signed thus saving tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives.
Glory to Wagner, Glory to the Russian Federation 🇷🇺
It's utter nonsense to believe that's your first spokesmodel is so desperate and angry that Ukraine is being demolished destroyed overrun and will eventually no longer be at country because England wanted that to happen. As long as the Russians use up a lot of their ammunition and get a lot of their soldiers killed we don't care what happens to Ukraine it can become a total radioactive meltdown region nobody cares... Least of all Boris Johnson and the British Parliament
Zelensky is a criminal 🤡
I thought Russia ran out of missiles
Most likely ukrAINE or the USA sabataged the pipe line!! FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS THE US STATE DEPT HAS TRIED TO STOP THE EU COUNTRIES FROM BUYING GAS FROM RUSSIA!! THE USA HAS SANCTION WHOLE TOWNS THAT NORDSTREAM 1 AND 2 GO THRU!!  STOPPING RUSSIAN GAS SALE HAS BEEN A 20 YEAR PROJECT OF VICTORIA NEWLAND(UNDER SEC OF STATE) SHE IS AN OLD LINE COMMIE HATER!! SHE AND CLINTION ENGINEERED THE MYDON REVOLUTION THAT STARTED THE UKRAINE RUSSIAN WARS BACK IN 2003!! SHE IS STILL THERE AT STATE DEPT.
Speaking of terrorism, the Sy Hersh exposè on the US bombing of Nordstream warrants a mention eh?
So having an expert from the institute of war that has Nuland and her husbands involvement explaining Russian disinformation to people is in no way anti Russian to begin with?..... Really?  OK then
GLORY to Russia 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Eastern & southern Ukraine should become part of Russia 🇷🇺.  Zalanzky need yo concede this and end the war.
Ukraine is losing.
The globalists greed has killed 1000s of young men.  All wars are bankers wars.
"The media are duplicitous and disingenuous. They complain about Russian ""disinformation"" though they themselves are more than happy to pump out their own disinformation 24/7, when it suits their own biased narrative. Who blew up the Nordstream pipeline, suddenly the media are extremely quiet, nothing to say, when everyone knows it was NATO and the Americans who blew it up, not the Russians.
 Is this the kind of disinformation they are discussing in the video?? The media has lost all its credibility, they twist, bend, contort the news constantly, every single day. to suit their own agenda. People are not fools."
Lies lies. Russia is winning. They are doing everything following international law. Russia could flatten Ukraine. Putin has ethics unlike the western leaders. Look at Iraq, Afghanistan and other wars started by the west. Did they win.? Did America win in Vietnam?
That was a lot of words to say nothing. Its just spin.  Ukraine is virtually out of ammo.  The US and EU is at present barely able to provide enough ammo to supply Ukraine losing.  They will never be able to provide enough for the fantasy 'counter attack' that lives in the imagination of the neocons in Washington.  Those countries are simply not set up for war production.  This is a grinding, methodical war the Russians are waging, and they are winning, and they will win. The ONLY responsible thing to do is to get to the negotiating table to save what is left of Ukraine.  Any other approach is delusional.
Stupid western propaganda 🤣
Russia is winning.
There is no folly involved. Russia took this necessary action with great reluctance, however, a necessary action it was and continues to be. By grinding down the Ukrainian forces while incrementally securing the Donbass region and all Russian-speakers within it. To have left the situation as it was with no prospect of either the autonomy for the region as agreed at Minsk or any halt to the Ukrainian shelling of the civilian population and with NATO creeping ever closer there truly was no good option left for Russia and so this operation began. Russia is achieving her goals. Time is not of the essence, whittling down the Ukrainian armed forces, destroying the capability of the Ukrainian regime to survive and bleeding the West of its financial and economic support Russia is winning on every front and will continue to do so. She also has the strong backing of Eurasian nations and those of the Global South. This geopolitical shift is increasingly leaving the western grouping isolated and exposed to further weakening as its already massive debts rise and its costs soaring. All in all we see the folly has all lain within the western orbit. Russia has prevailed. Time to admit it and come to terms.
Go 🇷🇺
Glory to Wagner, Glory to the Russian Federation 🇷🇺
Telegraph are doing a very low level war propaganda for Ukraine. The intellectual level of discussion is below the freezing point of liquid helium. The participants are, it appears, sexually aroused by this war, and they want it to continue it until the last Ukrainian soldier.
Ukraine is losing.
We support Russia. Period. 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Propaganda from both sides; in a war the first casualty is always the truth.  If the Russians are being beaten; who are the Ukrainians fighting?  If Ukraine is winning; why are the Russians still in their country?  This is a proxy war.  NATO always wanted to fight Russia; this is the way to fight Russia ... very cheaply.  By cheap I mean Russians and Ukrainians are doing all the dying.
Glory to Wagner, Glory to the Russian Federation 🇷🇺
When are we going to stop being puppets for US hegemony 👺🇺🇸 when are we going to stop peddling 💩 propaganda from Warmongers and lying mainstream media!!! When are we going to wake up to the Nord stream pipe line act of war by US on EUROPE which has systematically destroyed the economy, caused mass energy inflation, and the inevitable deindustrialization of Germany the back bone of Europe!!! US hegemony in a proxy war against Russia using Ukrainian citizens as cannon fodder is evil!!! This news is all bullshit shoveling on a mass scale. Just like the Iraq war and all the others on behalf of US industrial machine survival and hegemony 👺🇺🇸👺💰💰💰💰💰
This is war mongering Central. This is the latest 'reality denying' propaganda by our oligarch war Industry MSM. ALL LIES ALL THE TIME! Russia blew up it's own pipeline and Seymour Hersh's detailed report on who, how and why has first been ignored but is causing so many to wake up they created the 'Gilligan's Island' scenario. Forget President Zombie's promise to blow it up or Victoria Nuland's. Forget Poland's fascist leader 'Congratulating the US' for doing it. Don't beleive your lying ears, believe our oligarch spansored LIES. He who pay's the piper calls the tune!
lol they think defending bakhmut is for free. To the last ukrainian.
Sitting around puffing each other up. Russia 🇷🇺 wins!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
“ . . . Over 24 million downloads”. But fewer than 900k of this staggeringly nonsensical  tissue of lies. Russia pre-emptied an invasion of its territory by the USA and its vassal states straight thru the lowlands of Ukraine under its neoNazi putsch dictatorship.
Looking at the Minsk agreement, the west including UK@aine had no intention to keep the peace. We had nothing in the media about killings by their own government in Donbass. It is interesting to see how we in the west accepting neo nazism in UK@aine, brushing under the carpet the celebration of pro Hitler figure, Bandera. The affect of sanctions is enormous in Europe.
Glory to Wagner, Glory to the Russian Federation 🇷🇺
A more honest discussion would be Ukraine running out of shells, the narrative of Russia running out of shell has been propagandized by the mainstream western media since the war began but the Russians are still shooting 20,000-60,000 shells a day one year later.
this is insane  Ukraine is losing. end it. while there still is something left of Ukraine.
The US fired two missiles to shoot down a weather balloon, meanwhile Russia spilled a bucket of oil over a 32 million dollar military drone to bring it down. Not saying that oil has not got expensive, but hey...  How dare those Russian borders move so close to our drone?  So many questions, so few logical answers...
Russia 🇷🇺 🪆 🇷🇺 🪆 🇷🇺
America is losing its proxy war against Russia.
The West is begging for escalation.  HURAAAAA  🇷🇺
So much investigation and analysis by “journalists” (politically correct puppets controlled by the state instead of being impartial) on bringing down of a U.S. drone but silence when it comes to who blew up the nordstream pipeline that’s effecting the whole of Europe. Bravo! 👏
Glory to Wagner, Glory to the Russian Federation 🇷🇺
..17-3-23 Looks like the Ukrainian's have NO Answer at all - the Russian and Wagner Forces just keep pushing and pushing - taken more Land Areas and Towns - just Brilliant !!!! Glory to Mother Russia - the Bear is Roaring and Please do NOT Forget 2014 and Remember the Donbass !!!! Evil NATO Expansionism Aims will be Defeated and NATO Puppet Zelenskyy hunted down and hopefully Jailed !!!!
Ukraine trained army finished now only civilian is in war, untrained army, now sent Zelensky in front killer of 100thousand of ukraine army. 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇷🇺🇷🇺🇺🇸
😂❤😂❤😂🎉 Ukraine is winning🎉🎉🎉 Russia is running out of missiles and munitions🎉🎉🎉 the collective West's sanctions are working, they have isolated Russia from the banking crisis😮😮😮🎉🎉🎉🎉 Slava Z'Baby❤✝️🇷🇺
What is the point to discuss the lost proxy war, peace deal on its way.
Ukraine cannot win, it is out numbered by more than 3 to 1 and it is a war of attrition.  Russia will win in the end and get whatever territory it wanted.   Only if Putin is overthrown is where it might end sooner, assuming a more difficult leader does not replace him.   Russia is fine with canon fodder, it's the norm for them.  Soldiers don't mean that much to Putin, it is about winning.   They are shifting their economy to a war footing and with the help of the Chinses and selling oil, they can go on for a long time.
Slava Russia
Ukraine is losing.
Gee.  Russia has been running out of shells for months.  And missiles.  And then they don’t.  Send more ammo to Ukraine NOW.  Don’t count on Russian shortages.
🇮🇳dia❤❤🇷🇺ssia, Russia fought for India in year 1971 war with NATO/Pakistan
Western propaganda on this war is very misleading
Ukraine has lost about 8 million citizens,  one way or another   western propaganda 🤔
Perfidious Albion... Willing to fight to the last Ukrainian
Ukrainian the most corrupt country government president According to the Centre for Research on Globalisation, much of the $53.7 billion that the United States plans to give Ukraine will be stolen in corruption schemes orchestrated by Ukraine’s military, oligarchs, and government officials.

Just stop the War Give peace a chance.
Mariopol is Russian, it is not occupied territory, this sort of language is really unhelpful.
Who Putin come to the occupied Mariupol if Mariupol is Russia! 🇬🇧❤️🇷🇺

Putin was welcomed with open arms in Mariupol and Ukraine has lost the war, so stop lying.
Ukrainian murderers

"invasion in Ukraine in 2014 was a wake up call for us". LOL invasion in  Iraq in 2003 was a wake up call for Russia. Remember the famous Putin's speech in 2007 ? It was a result of unprovoked NATO's invasion in Iraq.
more fake brit news
Great western propaganda. Keep it up guys
Aiden Slin has now been exposed as a member of Azov with Far Right ideology. I guess Operation Gladio does exist after all.
The third term elected Chinese president doesn't have any time to talk to the puppets of America so zelensky is irrelevant. Russia and America must now seek favor with their new Chinese overlords. The EU will take whatever scraps left.
g7 already lost. Fight to the last Ukrainian right? Cowards
India red_heart Russia
Glory to Russia 🇷🇺
GO RUSSIA - RESPECT
Both Lukashenko and Zelensky are puppets of their masters Russia and the US respectively, they are getting used in this proxy but both are too damned stupid to realise, by the time the penny drops it will be too late for both them and their people.
The ridicilous propaganda here in the west has become so desperate that it's beyond hillarious, and now only embarrassing... According to our western "experts" Russia was out of ammo, equipment, fuel, soldiers, moral etc already in March last year. According to the propaganda from Washington and the na*iregime in Kiev should Putin already been dead because of allegedly terminal decieses. According to our western "experts" Russia has only shovels to fight with, but are still winning.  What happened to TRUE journalism here in the west..? Why have western media completely stopped asking our politicians and leaders critical questions, and trying to find the truth..?  USA, and therefore unfortunately us vasallstates here in Europe provoked through this proxywar, and after being pushed to far Russia did as they had warned us that they would do if we didn't stop. Russia started their very limited military operations in Ukraine well knowing that they would have to fight against entire NATO.  Even though Russia has been very restrained in their warfare we are still loosing.
Glory to Wagner, Glory to the Russian Federation 🇷🇺
"Folks look, everything is fine. Taxpayers will gladly foot the bill for it all. Not a joke!"
Ukraine is losing. Please can we let it end. We're using them as a battering ram against Russia and it is not working.
Zelensky bloody clown 🤡 🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸💰💰💰💰💰💰
Meanwhile Russia continues to push forward across almost the entire frontline. That's easily verified through live DPA maps and sources, Ukrainian, Russian and elsewhere. Major advances now in  Bahkmut in the northern industrial area and south and west pushing into the central administrative area. Avdiivka now heavily surrounded to the east, north and south in the fashion of Bahkmut. Ukraine are simply not repelling anything anymore that is of any significance or longevity. Time to get real. the media still living in the beginnings of this conflict when Russia deployed a limited military operation and not the full deployment and mobilisation we have seen for the past 4-5 months. Ukraine cannot and IS NOT winning this war. I guess only the unfolding of events moving forward will slap people awake.
Ukraine is losing  . glory to Russia 🇬🇧🇷🇺🇬🇧🇷🇺
Wow more insane propaganda from Jewish msm, how do people still believe this war mongering.
The whole situation is madness,, Russia won’t lose this proxy war with nato. Also who’s grip on the hegemony is slipping globally ?  The writing is clearly on the wall
USA is going the wrong way coz instead of promoting open source info the intel cabal and their criminal collaborators are trying hard to hoodwink the sovereign people in their evil efforts to hide crimes against humanity and the people on behalf of their handlers in the globalists elites and elitists Zion elders
What a load of bull shit....I can't believe feck all the British media are saying...Glory to Russia 🇬🇧🇷🇺🇬🇧🇷🇺
Go Russia, hail Putin 👌
Russia is winning the war fake new
Salva Russia 🇷🇺 ❤
Ukraine is collateral cannon fodder for the USA as dies on the world stage. Russia will win. US can't go up against the Russians on thier doorstep. Russia is not Afghanistan or Libya or Iraq.
Guess whose winning......🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Russia is winning this war. Why is nobody aknowledging this? A nuclear power that considers this fight as existencial will not and cannot stop until it wins. No matter the cost. Why are we lying to ourselves thinking ukraine can win? Ukraine is kept alive by the West. I'm not pro russia, i just think this war can't be won by Kiev
Ukraine is losing.
Ukrainian terrorists
Ukraine is finished.
NEVER! CRIMEA BELONG TO RUSSIA!
Russia 🇷🇺 is winning
Ukraine is having wet dreams about winning anything against Russia 🇷🇺. This guy is lying to the Ukrainian people and military….. everyone is getting killed in Ukraine and this clown is continuing to lie to the last man…. Someone should arrest him and bring him to the front line similar to those  soldiers who have lost their lives…. This clown who is calling himself a president of Ukraine is nothing more than a clown 🤡 and someone should arrest him and put him in the front lines…. Instead of traveling all over Europe and staying in 5 star hotels. On the soldiers expense of their lives. Shame on this clown who is to afraid to fight with the military instead.
30:28 "Putin started this war to prevent NATO expansion". No Hamish, it was the prospect of Ukraine joining that Russia could not tolerate (as well as the thousands of ethnic Russians being killed in the Donbass). Obviously Russia won't be happy about Finland/Sweden joining but provided they don't build up troops and equipment from other NATO members at its border then Russia won't feel the need to reciprocate.   All this talk of negotiating terms over Crimea is ludicrous. It has been home to what is arguably Russias single most important military asset since the 18th century. Nothing - including the threat of a third world war - will persuade them to give it up. Then there's the not insignificant fact that the very pro-Russian population exercised their right to self-determination and voted with an overwhelming majority to be a part of the Russian Federation. Ukraine will just have to cope.
Hmmm. Bakhmut costing Russia? I'd argue its a meat grinder in Russias favour. Ludicrous that people ignored the coup, ignored shelling of Donblass, the politics of Azov, Right Sektor and the idiocy of wanting to push NATO up to Russian border and put missiles within 5mins of Moscow. US foreign policy is a disaster and this proxy war that's cost 200billion, the EU and UK affordable energy, causing huge rises in food prices when we're already struggling with inflation and for what? Did anyone want Ukraine in NATO or EU,? Why did we find the Minsk agreements so unacceptable? Why are we accepting an actor who seems allergic to a suit, going round in his green tee shirt begging more money and the weaponry to start WW3...he couldn't stop Azov or make them withdraw in 2015 but we're not bothered about there characters getting stronger politically?  The history of Ukraine didn't start in 2022, we've all heard the US State Dept calls discussing which person they want after getting the democratically elected ousted. It's f**kin ridiculous.
It's a bit disingenuous as the war was also about the 12k dead ethnic Russians ukraine citizens who lived in the east of Ukraine. Finland has been Anti Russia for a while hence the army size. RUSSIA has not expressed a desire to invade countries enblock anywhere. Also u missed the part where Putin told the US ambassador that they where to blame for the war. Small point but I find small points interesting
Ukraine does not have its own weapons. Proxy war of the scoundrel of the West. NATO is at war with Russia through the hands of stupid Ukrainians.
This bucha  episode was all made up by the West to prevent and stop the peace talks that were going to bring the war to an end...
Denazification, was a stated goal of special military operation. Finland used swastika before Germany did. So I could see potential problems. Is not like neonazi groups do not exist there.
Thank God there's Russia 🤍💙❤️

Ukraine is losing.
A Wesyern audience who are beggining to see through the BS and need a way out. Ukraine cannot win. NATO is not set up for a large scale land war and has no money or weapions spare.
Blah blah blah... More propaganda peddled by the ukronazis and their main mentors, the anglosaxon pestilence 🥱
Glory to Wagner, Glory to the Russian Federation 🇷🇺
The Ukrainian Army is doomed
Ukraine is losing.
ZELENSKY STUPID..😂😂😂😂👎👎👎
Let’s face it. Ukraine is losing the war.
What's the difference between killing a man with guns, artillery, grenades, flamethrowers, precision bombs, or nuclear weapons , from beheading with a knife or sword 🗡️??? "NOTHING"!!!  Because "WAR" is  "WAR", and it's all about "KILLING"!! Why are the  Ukraine  people even fighting their Russian Brothers?? Because America could care less about the Urkrainian s and their way of life!!  This is just another one of America's proxy wars, like all the rest!! 😢😊
Why did the Telegraph not report the last 9 years of continues Ukraine shelling and killing of the ethnic Russian population in the Donbas region before Russians special military operation. This war was started with the military coup, organized and carried out by US led NATO war machine.  The rapist US President Bill Clinton admitted the US installed the drunk Boris Yeltsin as Russian President so American Corporations could plunder Russians natural resources of which they did for all of Yeltsin's term. Along comes President Putin and kicks them out, nationalised  the oil and gas, upsetting their feast. So begin the Demonisation of President Putin and Russia by the Western Main stream Media. Even Trump when asked was Putin a Killer, answered we have done a hell of a lot of killing ourselves.
I tend to interpret the headline like Azov regiment beheads Russian soldiers based on the past experience.
I’m gusssing most people haven’t seen the videos of Ukrainian soldiers killing Russian soldiers by smashing their heads in with bricks or the videos of them dropping grenades from drones on them as they sleep and laughing about it?
Ukrainian troops have done the same to Russian POW's but that isn't newsworthy is it? 👍🇮🇪🇷🇺🇷🇺
The issue with the documents is that they reveal Ukraine cannot win, despite the endless spin.
I stand with 🇷🇺 Russia 👑👑👏👍🇷🇺
Ukraine is losing ,Zelenskyy will be hung for treason.
Victory to great Russia.. Victory to truth 🇷🇺✌
Dom, Dom the 🌈🤡 parroting the West's 🤡🌍 narrative projecting Ukraine loses on Russia 🇷🇺 Slava Z baby ✝️🇷🇺
Russia forward! Glory and Victory to Russia!✌💪🚩
And the leak is, Ukraine is losing. The Swede
Zelenski,  and Ukraine's oligarchs have cost Ukraine at least 300,000 deaths, 13 million Ukrainian refugees, 1 trillion dollion dollars in destroyed infrastructure.  Biden, American and Ukrainian neocons, EU leaders give Zelinski arms because it's not their people who are suffering
Russia maladec 👍🇷🇺🙏❤️ keep doing a great work.
Love and respect Russia from Lithuania 🇱🇹🤝🇷🇺🙏
LONG LIVE PUTIN...
Attacking Russia is insane.
The truth must be told (& made known to all men): the Biden's White House  deceived Zelensky and destroyed Ukraine (Boris Johnson also truncated a promising peace agreement)!  Ukraine was/is only being used as a proxy ("to the last Ukrainian," they say) in the West's aggression against Russia!  Ukraine must seek peace with Russia and end this senseless crisis.  All men of goodwill must speak up against the dangerous hypocrisy of the USA-led West.
SLAVA RUSSIA CHECHNYA  ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ ZZZZZZZ
Nonsense Ukraine is losing and finish!!!!
Bull$hit western propaganda!
Zerlensky is a complete embarrassment and Russia was always going to crush the turds in Ukraine, stupid western war thats completely failed and made Russia much stronger and destroyed Ukraine forever,glory to Russia ❤from England
Vive la France vive la Russie 🇫🇷🇷🇺✌️✌️
Keep up the good work Russia
God is with Russia
😂😂😂Such BS propaganda 😂😂😂 🤡🌍 rated😂😂😂 Slava Z baby ✝️🇷🇺
Long live Putin! God is on his side and for his Russia! against all the manipulation of US plus NATO in Ukraine and Poland! I am from Poland and bless Russia with my whole heart! This is the only country in the whole world that won't bow before the american globalists. That's why they made this plot for years provoking to the war!
Long live Mother Russia 🇷🇺
Zelensky acting Clown 🤡
Green parties are backed by the CIA and are there to help destroy Europe economy and be sure that Europe stays in american colonialism and imperialism. Germany, and their master, the USA, (who still occupied them with military forces)  want to destroy France nuclear complex, that's why they have infiltrated and corrupted almost all french politicians, journalists, etc, etc. The best exemple is the current traitor Macron, a foreign agent who is there to destroy France and what's left of frenchmen. The true enemy for Europeans, and especially France, is the anglo-saxon empire, not the Russian. If we were not occupied and colonized, we will be willing to have an alliance, or at least a friendly understanding with Russia. It is to be noted that the so-called "European Union" is designed to put a wall between Western Europe and the bigest european country, with the biggest land, the biggest population, and the bigest ressources, Russia of course. A true european union, with sovereign states, could run the world, and send back the Yankees to their big american island.
Ukraine is losing.
Херсон is Russia
Glory to Wagner, Glory to the Russian Federation 🇷🇺
Ukraine is finished
ukraine should not listen to the USA pentagon to withdraw its troops from bacmut Russia will win there then conquer all of ukraine with victory
All of those people would still have their limbs if peace talks were promoted and pushed by the west. This podcast daily ridicules any peace movement. We will fight to the last Ukrainian! Well, guess what happens when things keep blowing up? This.
Propaganda! That's all this is. These so-called reporters need to do their homework. Back in 2014 the US backed a coup resulting in the Azof battalion bombing the people in the dunbass region killing upwards of 13,000 people. Putin had no choice but to protect these people and keep NATO off of Russia's border.
NATO is acting illegally by conducting clandestine war-operations in a non-NATO country and against an enemy with whom the West is not officially at war. Even the Washington Post has finally admitted that this is Biden's proxy war.
Of course the US has gained from the war it provoked.  US LNG is much more expensive than was Russian gas. It is not viable for industrial use. It   was genius  of the US  to blow up the Nordstream pipelines so that they could flog their  lng to us.
We love Russia stand strong Vladimir rid this world of the woke corrupt Ukraine UK Governments. 🇬🇧🇷🇺🇬🇧🇷🇺🇬🇧🇷🇺🇬🇧🇷🇺
The US will fight this proxy war til the last Ukrainian
This is not an invasion. It a retaliation attack by Russia against the Ukrainian regime that is responsible for brutal atrocities against the ethnic Russian civilians of Ukraine. The truth will prevail.
blow back from nordstream: us too carefree?
Reading these comments there seems to be no recognition that Russia is winning.  That's not to say that they will ultimately win, but the Ukranians appear likely to lose.  By lose I mean that Ukraine will be partitioned along the Putin Line, approximately, and that Russia will keep Crimea.  There are reports of a hypersonic missile striking an underground bunker.  According to these reports, a significant number of NATO and Ukrainian personnel were killed.  I am sceptical of these reports, and would like to know whether there is any truth to them.
hey didnt anyone tell telegraph Ukraine is losing?
💝 to Ruusia 🇷🇺 from 🇺🇸
another propaganda channel. diplomacy has to prevail and slaughter of ukranians has to be stopped. the longer fighting continue the more suffering to ukrainian population and infrastructure will be inflicted. people around the world have to realize this is a fight between US and russia, and ukrainians paying heavy price for this war so US will fight russia to the last ukrainian, and move to another project like taiwan? This happened to iraq, syria, libiya, vietnam, korea and many more countries so now it's all over again.
Russia's victory is inevitable! Glory to Russia!
If there was some lingering respect for British institutions it certainly  isn't any left now.   The simple truth is that Ukraine is losing in so many ways
We all know this is and has always been a US?NATO proxy war with the objective of destroying the Russian state. This something that only the most rabid neocon war hawks can dream of. It will never happen and on the contrary, it's the whole NATO states that are paying a heavy cost, to put it mildly, everyone can see that it's Europe and also the US that's shooting itself in the foot. Most of the world isn't onboard with the West attempts using Ukraine as their battleground. This is a sign that US is losing their hegemonic control over the Third World which are turning to China's economic plans for World peace in an multi polaric world.
WW3 over a tiny corrupt country full of neonazis.  Noice.
Glory to Wagner, Glory to the Russian Federation 🇷🇺
PURE PROPAGANDA FROM THE FILTH IN LONDON.  SAY HI TO SOROS U KUNTS
Ukraine could be a NATO state today and the other nato states haven't hato do more then they done today for Ukraine.. Nato is weak and only helps USA money machine... And tell the truth, Ukraine has always been a weak corrupt country..  Read Nato article 5, it's weak
Glory to Wagner, Glory to the Russian Federation 🇷🇺
😂 China going to swoop in and take Ukraine for more than usa and nato could give. West only wants their oil and gas anyway! 😂 China will give them billions and rebuild like they alright have in other countries. To piss the cwest off more. The cwest will loose everything spent. 😂 China will goto Sudan and other west proxy war countries soon and cut the west out forever! 😂
Ukraine is losing.
Russia 🇷🇺 has destroyed 4 Ukraine S-300’s and a German Gephard along with 700 Ukrainian troops in the last 24h..
Glory to Wagner, Glory to the Russian Federation 🇷🇺
But....Russia is winning
SLAVA RUSSIA, UKRAINE IS A CORRUPT CONTRY CONTROLLED BY A ANTI-CHRISTIAN AND COWARDICE LEADER. RUSSIA WILL LIBERATE THEM. 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺☦️☦️☦️☦️☦️☦️☦️☦️☦️☦️
As more innocent people suffer for an EU/US proxy war. Slava Kokaine  Smooth brains
The heavy missile attack today on Ukraine teaches the west an important lesson: Never underestimate the scientific and technological genius of Russia, the strategic brilliance of their military commanders and generals, the geostrategic acumen and vision of its politicians. The west mistakenly thought of Russia as 'a gas station with rockets' - a mistake it will regret for decades. The funniest part to me, though, was the destruction of the much acclaimed Leopard german tanks. All we can say now is solute our neonazi (sorry, meant german) brethren : Heil Scholzi, Heil Baerbocki, Heil Ursuli von der Schitten 🖕🇩🇪
Its over.  Russia won.
Ukronazi can't  even gather their forces to attack 😂😂😂 being uder constant Russian artillery barrage
Russia will win Ukraine and all that support them will fall
Ukraine is finished. That's the fact the western bullshit media just can't admit.
More lies Ukraine has lost more than 300,000 troops. Ukraine is losing 7 soldiers to 1 Russian killed and this  is fact! America are soon to pull out and concentrate on Taiwan. We will save this silly talk for when the war is over and play it back 😂😂😂😂😂.
So sad how Obama and Biden have ruined Ukraine with their proxy war.
propaganda ukraine is fecked
Russia has won already
This guy is a liar.  The leaked Pentagon papers told us everything.  Or was this sponsored by the Military Industrial Complex  who want Ukraine to fight to the last Ukrainian.  Ukraine has been decimated.  Let the world come together to end this war amicably .
Sure. comedian will launch counter-offensive and have got victory over Russia. I certainly believe it.
The fact that the west is bow majoring on 'torture' propaganda kinf of means the actual war has been lost. Don't expect any discussion of Kiev, Azov, Aidar, right sector, the massacre at the house of the trade unions in Odessa and so on. Bucha was a Kiev sponsored 'collaborator' cleansing AFTER the Russians had left.
Ukraine is losing.
All the usual 15 year okds with their experience commenting. Time the Telegraph told the TRUTH the Ukranian Army is finished so many dead and wounded it can barely function show some footage of BOYS being dragged away from their parents by UkroNazis to serve at the fron. ZZelinsky will most likely wind up assassinated by one of his own troops are already threatened to kill him
More puerile piffle from the No 1 clowns in the MI6/NATO propaganda machine.  It's main purpose is to keep gullible English conservatives ignorant about the causes of this ugly neocon-inspired conflict, foment spiteful russophobic attitudes throughout the Anglosphere - and bolster false hope that Ukraine is prevailing.
The western media spouting more propaganda
Clueless neocon analysis which is encouraging for the Russian strategists.  They will carry on 'failing' until the special military operation is successfully completed, namely Eastern Ukraine made safe and Western Ukrraine demilitarized.
Nordstream was blown up by US. A no brainer. See Seymour Hersch. See Col Macgregor on Ukraine 300k wounded and dead. Ditch this Sandhurst propaganda
Stop our warcriminal leaders Now STOP NATO. Stop the war now. RAUS AUS NATO!
false flag by who russia does not need a false flag but the question is the west getting tired of zelenski and looking for a way to mayrter him knowing ukraine is losing the war
Hey Telegraph, how is your country doing? The U.K. is going downhill economically. Slava Russia!
Btw, Ukraine has lost the Dombas, and Crimea. If Zzz had simply agreed to a peace deal all this could have been avoided- Lets face, he was elected on a card to bring peace between the Russian speakers in Dombas and the nationalists
Glory to Wagner, Glory to the Russian Federation 🇷🇺
Bakhmut became a place of extermination of the Ukronazis as a phenomenon and a turning point in the victorious confrontation between Russia and England since a loud statement back in 2007 ... Бахмут стал местом истребления укронацистов как явления и поворотным моментом в победном противостоянии России и Англии начиная с громкого заявления в далеком 2007 году ...
Slava🇷🇺🇷🇺
Slava Russia fae Scotland
Russia will win this war dont fool yourself
Prighozin yet again trolls western media, first saying a ceasefire had been agreed to allow american journalists into bakhmut, then 24 hours later reneges.  Now stages a tantrum to allow akhmat commandos from Chechnya to enter the battle to assure the capture of bakhmut by may 9th along with an agreement from the russian military for much needed munitions.  Got to give it to him, he knows how to play games with the west.  Enquiring minds however would like to know what zelenskiiy is up to with these extended meetings with blackrock ceo larry 'rat' fink.
Full support for the Russian Federation and it's allies 🇷🇺
Glory to Wagner, Glory to the Russian Federation 🇷🇺
So Russia would not be in Ukraine now if the US backed Ukraine government stopped bombing the donbas killing over 14000 thousand Russian speaking Ukrainians because they didn't want to be a part of a country with a non elected government in place.Russia repeatedly asked Ukraine to stop but they never did.I never see this anywhere for some reason
Russia will win these idiots still don't understand the objective of the war. The aim of the war is to destroy the Ukrainian military not take the whole country.  The Daily telegraph is useless
Nobody cares about Ucraine , British people first
Just watched the video of Zelensky paying the piano with his pr*ck... on some, not so talentented  show.  The clip wasn't  so long before Soros  put him in charge of the Ukraine.  Amazing also how real journalism has exposed the fact that Zelensky has  recently purchased 400 million dollars worth of oil from Russia..  .. the country  that the Ukraine is supposed to be at war with. 🤔   Facts found on Redacted and UK Column.    Civilians in thr Ukraine ..Russia.... UK...USA.... the world over  being played.
Victory to Russia 🇷🇺
Zelensky is Rumplestilskin

I hope Russia bomb Britain.
Slavo Russia!!!🎉
Bla bla bla Zelensky damn idiot
VIVA Russia!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Go Russia 🇷🇺👊🏻
Russia is the designated enemy which is a complete construct of the west to justify NATO,  Russia was never asked to join NATO back then because then there would be no enemy.. This war was instigated, provoked and created by the west intentionally.  If Mexico joined The Warsaw Pact and had put tanks on the U.S border, we would have attacked Mexico immediately, so why would we expect Russia to act otherwise if we put tanks on their border???  The European leaders are just proxy leaders for NATO and have subordinated their own people to NATO.
Western Propaganda here
Who blew up Nordstream?
We will destroy the Western armies ● Bakhmut has fallen! – The last building has been captured by the Russians - May 20, 2023 Slava Rossiya ❤️🇷🇺🪖💪😎
Russia 🇷🇺 is winning
Victory to Russia 🇷🇺💪 from Australia 🇭🇲🦘
Please stop worshipping those people in Ukraine who commited ******* on 250k Jews and 100k Polish villagers...
It's so tragic that America is now almost a vassal state of Russia. I never thought America would fall so easily.
Full scale invasion that's Iraq not ukraine small scale if 90 thousand entered! Get your facts straight mate!
yeah i get it ...... Russia is lossing the war........ right? 😉😉🤪🤡
Zelenski is lining his pockets in the meantime😂
U.S. led Nato (Fourth Reich) lost it's proxy war against Russia in Ukraine. Painful isn't it?
Nothing I've read corresponds to anything spoken here. The Ukrainian front line is collapsing.
Are we supposed to believe Ukraine are flying drones through the front lines for 1000km?
"Ukraine has long been completely insolvent, former Ukrainian Prime Minister (2010-2014) Nikolay Azarov said in commenting on the Standard & Poor’s rating agency’s downgrade of its credit rating on Ukraine’s sovereign debt to ""junk"" status.
 ""Ukraine is fully insolvent. However, international agencies do not risk assigning it a default rating. Although Ukraine went bankrupt long ago,"" he wrote on his Telegram channel.
 Earlier, S&P downgraded Ukraine from a ""CCC"" rating to ""CC."" ""Now the country’s long-term sovereign [debt] rating has received a highly telling stigma - ‘negative outlook,’ ‘a virtual certainty of default,’ ‘debt susceptible to non-payment,’"" the former head of the Ukrainian government added."
Kharkov is a Russian city.
NATO owes reparations
Russia is not our enemy.
Even if it's true, what's the problem? There are about 10000-12000 tanks of various modifications in Russia's warehouses. Losing even 20 is hardly a problem.
Ukrainians Won't Fight Zelensky’s War? Over 90% Unwilling To Risk Life On Battlefield: Poll https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvJKav-EEac Only 8 percent of Ukrainians are willing to fight on the battlefield against Russia in the war that has been raging for more than two years now. “Certainly, many people are willing to act, to send donations or work as volunteers. But facing a direct risk to life and taking part in military action – that is much harder… We estimate that the share of those willing to take arms is roughly 8% across all categories,” said Volodymyr Paniotto, head of International Institute for Sociology in Kyiv which reportedly conducted the poll.

Ukraine is losing. Stop the war.
RussiaRussiaflexed_biceps
Imagine thinking funding an endless conflict like this is a good idea, Peace deal now
This channel is a propaganda channel.Ukraine  has lost everything. Please  follow Alexander Mercurrious ,Scott Ritter for accurate story of Ukraine and gaza .
Tired of hearing about Ukraine.  Tired of blowing USA taxpayer money like water.
U.S. has weakened its subservient allies (EU) and strengthened Russia and China, who now are the most powerful strategic partnership on the security council. Those still pretending U.S. political will is capable of ruling the roost are having a rude awakening. Even Israel is totally indifferent to U.S. political will.
Russia not interested in letting U.S. led Nato off the hook over the Ukrainian catastrophe.
Victory lap time nearing for Putin over the collective failures that somehow rule over the West.
They could lose 90,000 tanks u nato pricks would still lose u leftist retards😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ukrainians are so resolute they are forcing men & women into a war zone....for Democracy.
"NATO Secretary General allowed Kiev to be defeated during the development of the conflict in Ukraine
 Stoltenberg acknowledged the possibility that NATO will not be able to supply Ukraine with the necessary amounts of weapons to confront Russia. So the West can't beat 2 percent of global GDP?🤔"
How dare NATO invade Ukraine!
The Western media has a very difficult task right now. Make the word ISIS out of the letters UKRAINE. But they are trying very hard. American journalist Alex Jones, in connection with the terrorist attack in Crocus, recalled that NATO always had a plan to use terrorists: "In the 1950s and 1980s, NATO had a plan called Operation Gladio. It is partially declassified. According to this plan, if Russia starts winning in any type of conflict in Europe, the [intelligence] networks remaining in its rear will stage terrorist attacks — to blame the Russians for what is happening, to turn public opinion against them. I've been doing research on NATO and NATO policy, and according to NATO's military doctrine, when the alliance loses a war (and Russia is fighting NATO right now), it turns to asymmetric warfare and terrorism."
No Nato in the Pacific.
Bunch of fucken cowards & traitors I hate the fact I'm American right now what a fucken shame traitor running coward in the  WH
Continuing the offensive from Artemovsk, the advanced units of the Russian paratroopers broke through the enemy's line of defense in Chasov Yar and approached the outskirts of the city.That's what military analysts say. The super fortress Chasov Yar is on the verge of destruction.
In my humble opinion if we make peace no more will die. Just agree to be a neutral country and disband NATO. Then with the money we save spend it on civillian projects. Move industry from arms into  shared sustainable development. Cooperate with  BRICS++. please no more bloodshed
Why not a $1 trillion aid package for Ukraine? Whatever it takes, right?
🇷🇺  Z 💪 V  🇷🇺 💪
Nothing to do with russian mis information. America is 35 trillion in debt and we are sick of our tax dollars being sent overseas. Europe can fight its on wars
Ukraine is losing the war …….. and this channel has done nothing but pushed for pointless bloodshed for many months …… COLD
Fed up hearing about Ukraine 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧
19:34 UK complaining about dictatorship is rich irony. UK economy is crap and your rights are just privelages.
The world has woken up to American backed NGOs Georgia's legislation is being repeated around the world. Every country has a obligation to protect.their citizens from outside interference .
Ukraine needs to ask for peace before it is too late.
Russia Target Foreign mercenaries Base In Kharkov, Destroying Drone Factory successfully targeted foreign mercenary bases in Ukraine, including a drone-producing ammunition depot, tanks, and a train carrying Ukrainian troops. These attacks come amidst heightened tensions, with increased Russian airstrikes following Kiev's attempted incursions into Russian border regions. Putin proposed a buffer zone (cordon sanitare ) to protect Russians in border areas last month.
Any updates on the Russians entering the easternmost suburbs of Chasiv Yar yesterday, or nah?
I hope Zelensky is not evolving himself to be a dictator! I pray 🙏 not!
Nobody cares stop giving billions to one of the most corrupt countries in the World .
The major mistake Russia made was trusting Western governments. After the collapse of the USSR, Russia was led to believe that its destiny was to be among the "Golden Billion." Instead of acting in good faith, the West has done nothing but behave treacherously towards Russia, grossly violating all norms of international law.  The consequence is that any trust once given is now completely gone. In its place a great schism has formed between Russia and the West, and this schism is leading to many former Western colonial subjects allying with Russia. Economically and politically, they strive to rid themselves of unwanted Western control, for the benefit of their own sovereign integrity.  Due to this schism, Russia now sees its future as a leader of a "Golden Majority" anti-hegemony pact. All systems under Western control, including the financial system, will be replaced with systems outside of its influence. Western military control will be driven out at every opportunity, as has happened recently in a number of African states.  In the long term, such a schism will be good for all parties, including the West. Instead of focusing on the lost cause of global domination and furthering the power of the ruling elite, the West will be forced to examine its role in the world and restore focus to the interests of its own people.  tass.com/politics/17650…  Yahoo Mail: Search, organise, conquer
