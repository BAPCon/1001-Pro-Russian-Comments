# 1001 Pro-Russian (and anti-West) Comments

This repository contains a dataset of 1001 pro-Russian comments sourced from various YouTube videos across different topics and channels. The comments were collected manually and filtered to ensure they represent a clear pro-Russian viewpoint.

## Purpose
The purpose of this dataset is to provide a resource for researchers, analysts, and other interested parties studying online discourse, information operations, or the dynamics of pro-Russian sentiment on social media platforms. 
The dataset can be used for various analyses, including:
- Sentiment analysis and opinion mining
- Network analysis and community detection
- Content analysis and thematic analysis
- Identifying patterns and trends in pro-Russian rhetoric
- Training and evaluating machine learning models for natural language processing tasks
- 
### Format
The dataset is provided as `json` (array of strings) and `txt` (lines).

## Limitations
Sample size: The dataset contains 1001 comments, which is a relatively small sample size. This may limit the generalizability of findings to the broader population of pro-Russian comments on YouTube.
Manual collection: The comments were collected manually, which may introduce some bias in the selection process.
Platform-specific: The comments are specific to YouTube and may not be representative of pro-Russian sentiment on other social media platforms.

## Future Work
We are actively working on expanding this dataset and adding more categories of comments, including:

- Pro-West comments: A collection of comments expressing pro-Western sentiments
- Neutral comments: A collection of comments that are neither pro-Russian nor pro-West
- 
These additional datasets will be added to this repository in the future.
